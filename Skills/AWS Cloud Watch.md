## Preparing Your Environment for AWS CloudWatch

To fully leverage AWS CloudWatch, it's important to set up services that generate logs and insights. In this section, we will create a serverless API using AWS Lambda, API Gateway, and DynamoDB, then generate logs for CloudWatch.

### 1. **Creating a Serverless API in AWS**

To create a serverless API backend using Lambda applications:

- In the AWS Console, search for **Lambda**.
- Navigate to **Applications** from the left-hand navigation bar.
- Click **Create Application**, and choose **Serverless API Backend**.
  
This will automatically create an API Gateway, a DynamoDB table, and Lambda Functions for our API. Follow these steps:

1. **Name the Application**:  
   Set the application name as `cloudwatchcourseapi`.
   
2. **Choose the Runtime**:  
   Select **Node.js** as the runtime environment.

3. **Source Control**:  
   Use **CodeCommit** for the repository, leaving the default name `cloudwatchcourseapi`.

4. **Set Permissions**:  
   Enable permissions by selecting **Create roles and permissions boundary**.

5. **Create the Application**:  
   Click **Create** to initialize the application.

### 2. **Generating Logs with API Requests**

Once the application is created, make requests to the API endpoint to generate logs for CloudWatch.

- Find the **API Endpoint** generated in the AWS Console.
- Copy the endpoint URL for use in the next step.

### 3. **Configuring the Sample Application**

A sample Node.js application is prepared to send requests to the API, generating logs in CloudWatch.

#### Steps to Run the Application:

1. **Open Visual Studio Code**:
   - Navigate to your project directory.
   - Open the terminal, and type:
     ```bash
     code .
     ```

2. **Install Node Packages**:
   - Navigate to the `api` folder and open the integrated terminal.
   - Run the following command to install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

3. **Update API Endpoint**:
   - Open the `.env` file in the `api` folder.
   - Replace the placeholder `API_ENDPOINT` with the actual API endpoint URL from AWS.

4. **Run the Application**:
   - To start the application, run:
     ```bash
     node server.js
     ```
   - The app will run on **localhost:8080**.

### 4. **Simulating API Requests**

The sample application will send a series of API requests, generating logs for CloudWatch.

- Define the number of requests you want to make (e.g., 100).
- By default, every third request will fail, creating error logs in CloudWatch for investigation.

#### Example of Simulated API Requests:
```javascript
// Simulate API requests
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  fetch(API_ENDPOINT)
    .then(response => console.log(`Request ${i}: Success`))
    .catch(error => console.log(`Request ${i}: Failed`));
}
```

If you want to simulate only failed requests, check the "All requests fail" option in the UI of the demo app.

### 5. **Generating Metrics in CloudWatch**

Let the application run for several minutes to generate sufficient logs and metrics. You can configure the app to send a large number of requests (e.g., 1,000 or 10,000) for more comprehensive metrics in CloudWatch.

```bash
// Initiate multiple requests
node server.js
```

After generating the logs, proceed to the AWS CloudWatch console to analyze the metrics and logs for further insights.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you set up a serverless API that generates logs and metrics for AWS CloudWatch. This environment provides valuable insights into the performance and health of your cloud applications, allowing you to monitor and troubleshoot effectively.

## Exploring CloudWatch Metrics

### What Are Metrics in CloudWatch?
Metrics in AWS CloudWatch represent a set of time-ordered data points that can be monitored. For example, when we make API requests, these activities are converted into metrics that CloudWatch tracks. Each metric is stored in a namespace, which helps in organizing them for various services.

### Navigating to CloudWatch Metrics

1. **Accessing CloudWatch**:  
   Go to your AWS console, type "CloudWatch" in the search bar, and open the CloudWatch service.

2. **Viewing Metrics**:  
   - On the left menu, expand **Metrics** and click **All metrics**.
   - Metrics are organized in **Namespaces**. You will see AWS namespaces and custom namespaces.
   - For our demo, we created a Lambda application with an API Gateway, Lambda functions, and DynamoDB.

### Viewing API Gateway Metrics

1. **API Gateway Metrics**:  
   - Open the **ApiGateway** namespace, and select **By API Name**.
   - Select the metrics for our application (`cloudwatchcourseapi`).
   - These metrics can then be added to the graph.

2. **Graphed Metrics**:  
   - After selecting the metrics, navigate to **Graphed metrics**.  
   - The data is initially grouped by a period of five minutes. You can hover over points to see details like latency.
   - To adjust the time granularity, change the period from five minutes to one second for more detailed insights. 
   
   ```python
   # Example of adjusting latency granularity
   metric_period = 1  # seconds
   ```

### Viewing Lambda Metrics

1. **Lambda Function Metrics**:  
   - Go back to **Browse** under namespaces and select the **Lambda** namespace.
   - Navigate **By Function Name** and find the Lambda function called `putItemFunction` that was invoked by our API Gateway.

2. **Viewing Invocations and Errors**:  
   - Select both **Invocations** and **Errors** metrics.
   - In the **Graphed metrics**, you will now see performance data for the function.

   ```bash
   # Example of Lambda invocation monitoring
   cloudwatch.get_metric_statistics(
       Namespace='AWS/Lambda',
       MetricName='Invocations',
       Dimensions=[
           {
               'Name': 'FunctionName',
               'Value': 'putItemFunction'
           },
       ],
       StartTime=start_time,
       EndTime=end_time,
       Period=60,
       Statistics=['Sum']
   )
   ```

3. **Error Analysis**:  
   - The metrics might display an error rate, such as 0.33, which is an average over five minutes.  
   - You can change the **statistic** from "average" to "sum" to see the total number of errors in a given time period.

   ```bash
   # Example for switching from average to sum in error metrics
   cloudwatch.get_metric_statistics(
       Namespace='AWS/Lambda',
       MetricName='Errors',
       Statistics=['Sum'],
       Period=300
   )
   ```

### Conclusion

AWS CloudWatch provides an intuitive interface to explore, monitor, and visualize metrics. You can analyze various aspects like latency, invocation errors, and overall performance of your APIs and Lambda functions. By switching between different statistics like average and sum, you gain a clearer understanding of your application's behavior and can fine-tune resources accordingly.

## Working with Custom Metrics in AWS CloudWatch

While AWS CloudWatch offers a variety of built-in metrics that provide valuable insights into service health, there are instances where businesses need more specific data. Custom metrics allow businesses to monitor unique business-critical data points, which aren't covered by standard metrics. By incorporating custom metrics, businesses can achieve more tailored monitoring that aligns with their specific objectives.

### Publishing Custom Metrics

Custom metrics can be pushed into CloudWatch using either the **AWS CLI** or the **CloudWatch API**. Once these metrics are available, they can be analyzed just like the built-in ones.

### Types of Metrics in AWS

- **Standard Resolution Metrics**: Have a data granularity of one minute and are the default type for AWS services.
  
- **High Resolution Metrics**: Have a data granularity of one second, useful for scenarios that require more fine-tuned monitoring. Although high-resolution metrics may not always be necessary, they can offer greater detail for certain business metrics.

### Custom Metric Example Using AWS CLI

```bash
aws cloudwatch put-metric-data \
  --namespace "CustomNamespace" \
  --metric-name "BusinessMetric" \
  --dimensions "InstanceId=i-1234567890abcdef0" \
  --value 23.5 \
  --unit "Milliseconds"
```

- **Namespace**: Custom metrics are grouped under a specific namespace.
- **Metric Name**: The name of the custom metric, e.g., `BusinessMetric`.
- **Dimensions**: Optional key-value pairs that help categorize the metric (e.g., by instance ID).
- **Value**: The data point value for the metric.
- **Unit**: Specifies the unit of the metric, such as seconds, bytes, or milliseconds.

### Conclusion

By using custom metrics in AWS CloudWatch, businesses can extend monitoring beyond built-in services, gaining more tailored insights that align with their specific needs. Whether using standard or high-resolution metrics, this customization can significantly enhance operational efficiency and provide a competitive advantage.

## Collecting Custom Metrics in AWS CloudWatch

### Overview
Custom metrics allow businesses to gather specific data about their applications and push it to AWS CloudWatch. This enables detailed monitoring and analysis, tailored to business needs. In this demo, we integrate custom metrics into an application, utilizing the AWS SDK and publishing metrics via the API.

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Add Dependencies
First, install the required AWS SDK packages:
```bash
npm install @aws-sdk/client-cloudwatch @aws-sdk/config-resolver
```

#### 2. Setting up IAM Permissions
To push custom metrics, you need to create a user with the necessary permissions:

- Navigate to the **IAM Console** and create a new user.
- Create a custom policy for the **CloudWatch** service with the `PutMetricData` permission:
  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "cloudwatch:PutMetricData",
        "Resource": "*"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
- Attach this policy to the user you create (e.g., `pushcustommetrics`).
- Generate an access key and secret key for the user.

#### 3. Configure Environment Variables
In your application's `.env` file, provide the following values:
```bash
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-access-key>
SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-secret-key>
```

#### 4. Publish Custom Metrics

Create a file `cloudwatchMetrics.js` to handle metric publishing. This will define the parameters and make the API call to CloudWatch.

```javascript
const { CloudWatchClient, PutMetricDataCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-cloudwatch");

// Initialize CloudWatch client
const cloudwatchClient = new CloudWatchClient({
    region: process.env.AWS_REGION,
    credentials: {
        accessKeyId: process.env.ACCESS_KEY_ID,
        secretAccessKey: process.env.SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    }
});

// Function to publish a custom metric
const publishMetric = async (metricName, value, dimensions = []) => {
    const params = {
        MetricData: [
            {
                MetricName: metricName,
                Dimensions: dimensions,
                Timestamp: new Date(),
                Value: value,
                Unit: "Milliseconds"
            }
        ],
        Namespace: "CloudWatchApiCourse/Performance"
    };

    try {
        const command = new PutMetricDataCommand(params);
        await cloudwatchClient.send(command);
        console.log("Successfully published metric to CloudWatch");
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error publishing metric:", error);
    }
};

module.exports = { publishMetric };
```

#### 5. Use Custom Metrics in Your Application

Within your server logic, integrate the metric-publishing function to capture custom data such as **response time**.

```javascript
const { publishMetric } = require("./cloudwatchMetrics");

const startTime = new Date();
// Simulate API call
const endTime = new Date();
const responseTime = endTime - startTime;

// Specify dimensions (e.g., environment, endpoint)
const dimensions = [
    { Name: "Environment", Value: "Production" },
    { Name: "Endpoint", Value: "/api" },
    { Name: "HttpMethod", Value: "GET" }
];

// Publish custom metric
publishMetric("ResponseTime", responseTime, dimensions);
```

#### 6. Running the Application
Start your server:
```bash
node server.js
```

When requests are made, the custom metric data will be published to CloudWatch. Successful operations will log:
```
Successfully published metric to CloudWatch
```

#### 7. Viewing Metrics in CloudWatch

- Go to the **CloudWatch Console** and navigate to **All Metrics**.
- Look for the namespace you defined, e.g., `CloudWatchApiCourse/Performance`.
- You will find the custom metric (`ResponseTime`) along with dimensions such as `Environment`, `Endpoint`, and `HttpMethod`.

#### 8. Visualizing Metrics
- Select the metric and view it in **Graphed Metrics**.
- Change the time granularity to **5 seconds** for more precise monitoring.
- You can switch from average to sum for a cumulative view.

### Conclusion
Using custom metrics allows businesses to collect specific data points that are critical for decision-making and operational efficiency. By integrating custom metrics into CloudWatch, you can visualize and monitor the performance of key aspects of your application.

# Streaming Metrics in AWS CloudWatch

CloudWatch provides businesses with insights into various aspects of their infrastructure, but metrics can be used for more than just monitoring. **Streaming metrics** enables businesses to stream data to different AWS services for further processing and analysis, unlocking deeper insights and facilitating data-driven decisions.

## Setting Up a Metric Stream

To set up metric streaming in CloudWatch:

1. **Navigate to Metrics Stream**:
   - Under the Metrics tab, select **Streams** and create a new metric stream.
  
2. **Choose Metrics to Stream**:
   - You can either stream metrics from individual namespaces or select all namespaces.
   - Exclusions are possible if you want to stream all except specific namespaces.

### Code Snippet Example:
```bash
aws cloudwatch put-metric-stream --name "streamdemo" --output-format "json"
```

## Configuration of Metric Stream

After selecting metrics, you need to configure the destination of your metrics stream:

- **Quick S3 Setup**: 
  - Automatically creates an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose and sends the data to an S3 bucket.

- **Using Existing Firehose**:
  - You can choose an existing Kinesis Data Firehose or set up a new one. The source has to be set to **Direct PUT** to allow CloudWatch to push the data.

### Configuration Example:
```bash
aws firehose create-delivery-stream \
  --delivery-stream-name streamdemo \
  --delivery-stream-type DirectPut \
  --s3-destination-configuration file://s3-config.json
```

## Destinations for Metric Streams

You can send your metrics to various AWS services, including:
- **Amazon S3**: To store data.
- **Amazon Redshift**: For data warehousing.
- **HTTP Endpoints**: To integrate with third-party services like MongoDB, Logz.io, etc.

## Verifying the Metric Stream

Once your stream is configured, initiate traffic to your application to generate metrics:

1. Generate test traffic (e.g., 100 requests).
2. Monitor the stream in the **Kinesis Data Firehose** section.

   - **Monitoring Metrics**:
     - You can view details such as incoming bytes, put requests, and data delivery status to S3.

3. Once active, data will appear in your destination (e.g., S3 bucket) after a short delay for batching and processing.

### Traffic Generation Example:
```bash
for i in {1..100}; do curl http://your-application-endpoint; done
```

## Finalizing the Process

- After a few minutes, you can verify that the data is successfully streamed to your S3 bucket by navigating to **Amazon Kinesis Firehose** > **Delivery Stream** > **Monitoring** and checking the incoming records.

### Verifying Data in S3:
```bash
aws s3 ls s3://metrics-streams-streamdemo
```

---

This setup allows organizations to leverage CloudWatch streaming for customizable and actionable business insights, providing flexibility in choosing destinations and maximizing the value of their data.

### **Working with Metric Math Expressions in CloudWatch**

Amazon CloudWatch offers a feature called **Metric Math**, enabling the calculation and real-time analysis across multiple metrics using mathematical expressions. This feature helps derive insights from existing metrics and create new time series data streams.

#### **Steps to Implement Metric Math in CloudWatch**

1. **Navigate to All Metrics**
   - Go to CloudWatch, select **All Metrics**, and choose the metrics you want to process. For example, select the **Lambda function by function name**.
   - Find the **PutItem function** and select the **Error metric**.

2. **Viewing Graph Metrics**
   - After selecting the metrics, expand the graph. If no data is visible, adjust the timeframe (e.g., latest four weeks).
   - Add math expressions to further process the metrics by selecting **Add Math**.

#### **Using Rate Function for Error Metrics**

- The **Rate function** calculates the rate of change between the latest and previous data points.

   ```plaintext
   Add Math -> Find Rate Function -> Select Rate Function
   ```

- This adds a second graph showing the rate of errors. You can modify the metric ID for clarity. For instance, change the aggregation of error metrics from **Average** to **Sum** to get a clearer picture of error rates.

   ```plaintext
   Change Aggregation: Average -> Sum
   ```

#### **Editing Metric Math Expressions**

- You can edit the math expressions to customize calculations. For example, to focus on errors only:
  
   ```plaintext
   Edit the expression -> Use metric ID (e.g., M1 for errors)
   ```

   This filters the graph to show only errors, removing other unwanted metrics like invocations.

#### **Using Day Function for Filtering Errors by Weekdays/Weekends**

- To filter metrics by days of the week, use the **Day function**.

   ```plaintext
   Add Math -> All Functions -> Day Function
   ```

   - The **Day function** returns the day number (1–7). Days 6 and 7 represent the weekend (Saturday and Sunday).
   - You can filter errors that occurred on weekends using an **if statement** in the expression.

   ```plaintext
   if(day >= 6) // Show errors during weekends
   ```

#### **Filling Missing Data Points with the Fill Function**

- If the graph has missing data points (due to infrequent errors), you can use the **Fill function** to make the graph more readable by filling in missing points with zeros.

   ```plaintext
   Add Math -> Common -> Fill Function
   ```

   - This fills missing data points with the value you specify. For example, fill missing points in the error metric (M1) with `0`:

   ```plaintext
   fill(M1, 0)
   ```

   After applying this, the graph will show continuous lines, even when errors are absent.

#### **Conclusion**

In this demo, we explored various ways to process and analyze metrics in CloudWatch using **metric math expressions**, including:
- Using the **rate function** to calculate error rates.
- Filtering metrics using the **day function**.
- Enhancing graph readability with the **fill function**.

These tools help improve real-time data visualization and analysis within CloudWatch.

### **Creating Custom Metric Math Expressions in CloudWatch**

In this section, we explore how to create custom math expressions using multiple metrics to generate new data points in Amazon CloudWatch. This allows for more detailed analysis by performing mathematical operations on existing metrics.

#### **Selecting Metrics**
To begin, we need to select multiple metrics, such as:
- **Errors**
- **Invocations**
- **Duration**

Navigate to the metrics selection and choose these for further analysis.

#### **Average Duration per Invocation**

We can calculate the **average duration per invocation** by dividing the **duration** by the **invocations**.

- **Duration** is identified as `M3` and **Invocations** as `M2`.

The formula for average duration is:
```plaintext
M3 / M2
```

1. Add a new math expression.
2. Input the expression: `M3 / M2`.
3. Apply the expression to view the average duration in milliseconds.

#### **Calculating Error Rate**

To calculate the **error rate**, divide the **errors** by the **invocations**. Errors are labeled as `M1`.

- **Error Rate Formula**:
```plaintext
M1 / M2
```

- **Converting to Percentage**:
Multiply the error rate by 100 to get the percentage:
```plaintext
(M1 / M2) * 100
```

Once applied, this shows the error rate, which may vary (e.g., 100%, 33%) depending on application behavior.

#### **Filtering Error Rate with IF Function**

We can further filter the data by using an **IF function** to display only data where the error rate is above a specified threshold, such as 25%.

- **IF Function Syntax**:
```plaintext
IF(E1 >= 25, E1, 0)
```
Here, `E1` represents the error rate percentage.

1. Add a new math expression using the `IF` function.
2. Replace `E1` with the metric ID for error rate.
3. Set the condition `E1 >= 25` to display error rates 25% or higher. Values below 25% will be shown as `0`.

#### **Example Code Snippet**
For an error rate of 25% or higher:
```plaintext
IF(E1 >= 25, E1, 0)
```

To modify this threshold, for example to 75%, you can update the expression:
```plaintext
IF(E1 >= 75, E1, 0)
```

#### **Summary**

- **Average Duration**: `M3 / M2`
- **Error Rate (Percentage)**: `(M1 / M2) * 100`
- **Conditional Error Rate (Above 25%)**: `IF(E1 >= 25, E1, 0)`

These custom math expressions allow for more detailed, real-time insights into system performance and can be tailored based on specific needs.

Next, we will explore how to save these graphs and add them to a CloudWatch dashboard.

### **Adding Metrics to CloudWatch Dashboards**

In this section, we explore how to add and save custom metrics to a CloudWatch dashboard for easy access and monitoring.

#### **Creating a Dashboard**

To avoid losing your metrics and charts when you close the browser, you can save them by adding them to a CloudWatch dashboard. Dashboards allow you to visualize key metrics and manage them across different devices or sessions.

1. Navigate to **Dashboards** in CloudWatch.
2. Create a new dashboard by selecting **Create Dashboard** or edit an existing one.
3. For this demo, name the dashboard `Metrics`.

#### **Adding Widgets to the Dashboard**

Once the dashboard is created, you can add different types of widgets to display your data:
- Line Graphs
- Alarm Statuses
- Custom Widgets
- Text
- Logs

In this case, we will add a **Line Graph** for our metrics.

#### **Steps to Add Metrics to the Dashboard**

1. Select the **Line Graph** widget and click **Next**.
2. Choose the desired **metrics** for the graph.
   - This is similar to how metrics were selected earlier: navigate to **Graph Metrics**, select the metrics, and add math expressions as needed.
3. After setting up the metrics, select **Actions** > **Add to Dashboard**.
4. Select the dashboard, which in this case is `Metrics`.
5. Choose the **widget type** (e.g., Line Graph).
6. Assign a **title** to the widget, such as `MathExpression`, and then add it to the dashboard.

#### **Editing and Managing Widgets**

Once the widget is added, you can easily view and edit the metrics in your dashboard at any time.

- Navigate back to the dashboard to view the graph and make necessary changes.
- Depending on your use case, you can add multiple widgets for various metrics, tailoring the dashboard to your firm's specific business needs.

This process allows for continuous monitoring and real-time analysis of important data without needing to reconfigure the metrics every time.

# Querying Logs for Insights Using AWS CloudWatch

### Overview
CloudWatch Logs helps in troubleshooting application bugs by querying logs and identifying errors. While CloudWatch metrics provide frequency data, logs give insights into what happened within your application. This guide explains how to use AWS CloudWatch Logs and Log Insights for effective log querying and error resolution.

### Steps to Query Logs

#### 1. **Navigating to Log Insights**
   - Go to the AWS CloudWatch Console.
   - Under **Logs**, select **Log Insights**.
   - Ensure the correct **timeframe** is selected (default is the last one hour, but custom timeframes can be set based on your error window).

#### 2. **Selecting a Log Group**
   - Each AWS service sends logs to its own log group (e.g., CodeBuild, Lambda).
   - Select the appropriate **log group** for querying data. For example, if using a Lambda function, select the relevant log group such as `putItemFunction`.

#### 3. **Executing a Query**
   - Use the **fields** operation to specify the fields you want to display.
   - Optionally, use **sort** and **limit** to control the query results. Limiting results helps reduce the cost of querying large log datasets.
   - **Run the query** to retrieve log data. If no results are displayed, ensure requests are being generated by testing locally.

#### 4. **Filtering for Errors**
   - **Filter** the logs by specific error messages using a pipe `|` followed by the filter command:
     ```bash
     | filter message like /Exception/
     ```
   - This filter will return logs containing the word "Exception." Expanding the logs reveals detailed information like error types and error messages. In this example, an error message might say:
     ```bash
     Error Type: ValidationException
     Error Message: Missing key ID in the payload
     ```
   - Viewing the **stack trace** helps identify the location and cause of the error.

### Aggregating Log Data

#### 1. **Using Stats for Aggregation**
   - You can use aggregate operations like `sum`, `average`, `max`, and `min`. For example, to count all requests that resulted in an exception:
     ```bash
     | filter message like /Exception/ 
     | stats count(*) as error_count
     ```
   - Running this query returns the **error count** (e.g., `66` errors).

#### 2. **Grouping Data Over Time**
   - To visualize error counts over time, group them into periods (e.g., 5-minute intervals):
     ```bash
     | filter message like /Exception/
     | stats count(*) as error_count by bin(5m)
     ```
   - This returns error counts grouped by 5-minute periods, which is useful for tracking trends and visualizing issues.

### Conclusion
Using AWS CloudWatch Log Insights enables you to filter, aggregate, and visualize log data, helping you quickly identify and resolve application errors. This tool is essential for efficiently debugging issues in production environments.

# Creating Log Metrics Using AWS CloudWatch

### Overview
In CloudWatch, we can convert logs into metrics to gain better insights into application performance and error handling. This process allows us to visualize the frequency of specific errors over time, providing an easy way to monitor and improve applications. This guide explains how to create log metrics from application logs in AWS CloudWatch.

### Steps to Create Log Metrics

#### 1. **Navigating to Log Groups**
   - Go to the **CloudWatch Console** and navigate to **Log groups** under Logs.
   - Select the appropriate **log group** that corresponds to your AWS service (e.g., Lambda function for this example).

#### 2. **Starting Log Events**
   - If no logs are available, start the demo app or initiate requests to generate logs. Preferably, make requests that **fail** so errors are logged, allowing you to create metrics from those errors.
   
#### 3. **Creating a Metric Filter**
   - To create a metric, navigate to **Metric Filters**.
   - Click **Create Metric Filter**.
   
#### 4. **Defining a Filter Pattern**
   - Define a filter pattern to match the logs of interest. This works like an `if` statement where if a condition is met, the metric is incremented.
   - For example, to match log events containing specific error messages, use the pattern:
     ```bash
     errorType = ValidationException
     ```
   - This pattern increases the metric count whenever a log with `ValidationException` in the `errorType` field is found.
   
#### 5. **Testing the Filter Pattern**
   - Test the pattern using either existing logs or custom data. Paste the copied error logs (e.g., `ValidationException`) to check if the pattern matches.
   - Once tested, confirm that at least one row matches, indicating that the filter pattern is working.

#### 6. **Naming and Configuring the Metric**
   - Name the filter (e.g., `ValidationExceptions`) and specify a **namespace** for the metric (e.g., `MetricFilters`).
   - Set a **metric value**, usually `1`, which increments every time the filter matches.
   - Optionally, you can set default values (e.g., `0` when no logs match) and configure other properties like **units** and **dimensions** if needed.

#### 7. **Review and Create the Metric Filter**
   - Review your configuration and create the metric filter. Once created, start some requests in your application to generate logs that match the filter.

#### 8. **Viewing the Metrics**
   - Navigate to the **Metrics** section in CloudWatch and view the new metric under the specified namespace.
   - For example, you should see **ValidationExceptions** appear in the metrics list. This can now be used for graphing and monitoring in your application dashboards.

### Example: Creating a Metric for `ValidationException`

```bash
# Filter pattern for ValidationException errors in the logs
errorType = ValidationException
```

### Conclusion
Creating log-based metrics in AWS CloudWatch allows you to efficiently monitor errors and application performance over time. With metric filters, you can easily track specific issues like `ValidationExceptions` and visualize these metrics in CloudWatch dashboards for deeper insights.

## CloudWatch Alarms Overview

### Purpose of CloudWatch Alarms
CloudWatch Alarms help automate the monitoring process and notify you when something goes wrong with your services. Instead of manually checking CloudWatch metrics and logs, alarms can proactively alert you or trigger specific actions when predefined conditions are met.

### How CloudWatch Alarms Work
- **Threshold Monitoring**: Alarms allow setting a threshold on CloudWatch metrics. When this threshold is crossed, the alarm triggers an action.
- **Example**: You can monitor the failure rate of API requests. When failures hit a defined limit, the alarm sends notifications to responsible personnel, allowing quick response.

### Benefits of CloudWatch Alarms
- **Proactive Monitoring**: Alarms notify you instantly when issues arise, helping to mitigate problems before they escalate.
- **Automation**: You can automate actions based on alarm triggers. For example:
  - Automatically scale up instances in an EC2 Auto Scaling group when CPU usage exceeds a threshold.
  - Automatically scale down or shut down instances when CPU usage drops below the threshold.

### Key Use Cases
- **Resource Management**: Use alarms to manage underutilized resources and ensure you’re running only what’s necessary. This keeps costs low and performance optimal.
- **Performance Monitoring**: By monitoring critical metrics with alarms, you can continuously stay informed about the performance of your cloud environment without needing to manually check the AWS CloudWatch Console.

### Example Use Case: Auto Scaling with CloudWatch Alarm
```plaintext
1. Set an alarm for EC2 CPU usage.
2. If CPU usage exceeds 80%, add more instances to the Auto Scaling group.
3. If CPU usage drops below 30%, remove excess instances.
```

By automating these actions, you ensure that your resources scale according to demand, saving costs during low-demand periods while maintaining performance during high-demand periods.

### Best Practices
- Always set alarms for critical metrics so that you're informed of any performance issues promptly.
- Leverage alarms to not only notify but also take action (such as scaling resources or stopping unused services). This optimizes both performance and costs.

## Creating CloudWatch Alarms to Monitor Infrastructure

### Overview
In this demonstration, a CloudWatch alarm is set up to monitor an API's performance and notify administrators if too many failed requests occur. The alarm is configured based on the `Errors` metric, and notifications are sent via email to the appropriate admin team.

### Step-by-Step Instructions

#### 1. Initiate API Requests
To simulate failed requests for the API, initiate 100 requests. In this case, for every three requests, one will fail, setting a baseline for the alarm configuration.

#### 2. Navigate to CloudWatch Console
- Open the **CloudWatch Management Console**.
- Go to **Alarms** > **All Alarms**.
- Click **Create Alarm**.

#### 3. Select a Metric
- Choose the metric under **AWS namespaces**.
- Select **Lambda** > **Function name** > **Errors** for the Lambda function `putitemFunction`.
- The **Errors** metric tracks failed API requests.

#### 4. Configure the Alarm Statistic
- Set the **Statistic** to `Sum` (not `Average`) to better capture the total number of failed requests.
- Set the time period to **1 minute** to allow the alarm to trigger faster. For example, in 5 minutes, you might observe 140 failed requests.

#### 5. Define Alarm Conditions
- Choose the **Threshold Type**: Static value.
- Set the threshold condition to `Greater than`.
- Set the threshold value to **20 failed requests per minute**. Based on the API's request rate, this threshold ensures the alarm will trigger when failure rates exceed the normal baseline.

#### 6. Notification Setup
- Create a new **SNS topic** to receive notifications.
- Name the topic `apiadmins`.
- Add the email address(es) to notify, separating multiple addresses with commas if necessary.

```plaintext
Example Topic:
apiadmins: admin@example.com
```

- Ensure notifications are sent when the alarm enters both the `Alarm` and `OK` states.

#### 7. Name and Create the Alarm
- Name the alarm `apiadmins`.
- After creating the alarm, it will initially be in the `Insufficient Data` state.

#### 8. Test the Alarm
- Restart the API request simulation tool, this time configuring it to **Fail all requests**.
- After a few seconds, the alarm will enter the `OK` state, and you will receive a notification about the state change.
- When enough failed requests accumulate, the alarm will switch to the **Alarm state**, triggering another notification.

### Example CloudWatch Alarm Configuration

```json
{
  "AlarmName": "apiadmins",
  "Metric": "Errors",
  "Namespace": "AWS/Lambda",
  "Statistic": "Sum",
  "Period": 60,
  "Threshold": 20,
  "ComparisonOperator": "GreaterThanThreshold",
  "ActionsEnabled": true,
  "AlarmActions": [
    "arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:apiadmins"
  ],
  "OKActions": [
    "arn:aws:sns:region:account-id:apiadmins"
  ],
  "EvaluationPeriods": 1,
  "AlarmDescription": "Alarm for monitoring API failed requests"
}
```

### Conclusion
Once the alarm is triggered, administrators are notified. The alarm will switch back to the **OK** state when the issue is resolved, ensuring that admins stay informed without needing redundant actions.

### **Configuring CloudWatch Alarms for EC2 Auto Scaling**

     sudo stress-ng --cpu 4 --timeout 60s
     ```

4. **Monitor CPU Usage**:
   - Watch for CPU spike in CloudWatch console.
   - Wait for the alarm to trigger, which will cause a new instance to be added.

5. **Check Scaling Down**:
   - After CPU usage returns to normal, the system will scale down, removing the extra instance.

---

### **Step 5: Verify Results**

- Navigate back to the **Auto Scaling Group**.
- Check that instances are added when the CPU usage spikes and removed when the CPU load decreases.
- The scaling actions should match the alarm state changes between **Alarm** and **OK**.

---

By following this process, you can efficiently scale EC2 instances based on real-time CPU usage, ensuring optimal resource utilization based on demand.

   - Example filter query for client node:

   ```bash
   service id name: "Scorekeep" and type client
   ```

2. **Viewing Trace Details**:
   - After running the query, you can view all traces made in the last 15 minutes.
   - Select a specific trace (e.g., POST request), and you can see the request's flow through the system.
   
   ```plaintext
   Client -> POST Request -> Game Table (DynamoDB) -> Session Table (DynamoDB)
   ```

3. **Analyzing Trace Latency**:
   - The trace map provides details on how long each service took to process the request.
   - You can trace individual requests, identify which services took the most time, and locate potential bottlenecks in the system.

### **Step 4: Performance Insights Using X-Ray**

- AWS X-Ray allows you to:
  - Track the request lifecycle from client to backend.
  - Identify **slow** or **failed** requests.
  - Visualize **bottlenecks** in the service map.
  - Get insights on which services are causing performance issues by observing **latency** and **error rates**.

**Example:**  
In the trace map, a POST request affects both the **game table** and **session table** in DynamoDB. If either service has a slow response time, it can be identified by looking at the duration metrics in the trace details.

AWS X-Ray simplifies troubleshooting by providing a clear visual of request flows and interactions, making it easier to detect and resolve performance issues.

### **Integrating AWS X-Ray with Other AWS Services**

In this demo, we explore how to integrate AWS X-Ray with additional AWS services, such as **API Gateway** and **Lambda** functions. By enabling tracing for these services, we can monitor and analyze request flows and diagnose errors more effectively.

---

### **Step 1: Enabling X-Ray for API Gateway**

1. **Locate API Gateway**:
   - Search for the **API Gateway** (in this example, named `CloudWatch API`).
   - Navigate to **Stages**, and select the relevant stage (e.g., `production`).

2. **Enable X-Ray Tracing**:
   - Under the **Logs/Tracing** section, scroll down and enable **X-Ray Tracing**.
   - Save the changes.

---

### **Step 2: Enabling X-Ray for Lambda Functions**

1. **Locate Lambda Function**:
   - Find the Lambda function related to the API Gateway (e.g., `putitemFunction`).
   - The function name typically follows this format: `<gateway-name>-putitemFunction`.

2. **Enable Active Tracing**:
   - Go to **Configuration** > **Monitoring and Operation Tools**.
   - Click **Edit** and enable **Active Tracing** for the Lambda function.
   - Save the changes.

---

### **Step 3: Generating API Requests**

1. **API Tester Tool**:
   - Use the API tester tool provided in the exercise files.
   - Generate a large number of API requests (e.g., 1000 requests).
   - Every third request is designed to fail for testing purposes.

---

### **Step 4: Viewing the Service Map in CloudWatch**

1. **Navigate to X-Ray in CloudWatch**:
   - Open the **CloudWatch Management Console**.
   - Go to **X-Ray Traces** and view the **Service Map**.

2. **Service Map Overview**:
   - The service map shows a client making requests to the **API Gateway** production stage, which in turn triggers the **Lambda function**.
   - Failed requests are highlighted in red.

---

### **Step 5: Analyzing Failed Requests**

1. **API Gateway Failures**:
   - In the service map, click on the API Gateway node.
   - Notice that 35% of requests are failing, indicated by a **red circle** (response code `502`).

2. **Lambda Function Errors**:
   - The Lambda function node shows a **yellow circle**, indicating that it returns `400` errors (e.g., `Bad Request`).
   - Lambda does not return `500` errors, so it’s not marked in red.

---

### **Step 6: Debugging Failed Requests**

1. **View Trace Details**:
   - Click on the API Gateway in the service map and view traces.
   - Scroll down to find and open a failed request.

2. **Trace Breakdown**:
   - The API Gateway calls the Lambda function, but the Lambda function fails to return a successful response.
   - Expand the trace details to view the **exceptions**.

3. **Identify the Error**:
   - The error message indicates that the key `ID` was missing in the item, which caused the failure.
   
   **Exception Example**:
   ```bash
   Exception: One or more parameter values were invalid, missing the key ID in the item.
   ```

---

### **Step 7: Fixing the Error**

- With X-Ray tracing, it becomes straightforward to identify the root cause of failures.
- In this case, fixing the missing parameter in the Lambda function should resolve the issue.

AWS X-Ray enables seamless integration with API Gateway and Lambda, making it easier to trace requests, monitor performance, and diagnose errors efficiently.
