Based on your resume and the job description (JD) for the Software Engineer, DevOps role at Checkpoint, here’s a tailored analysis of what you should brush up on and focus on before your interview tomorrow, March 21, 2025. I’ll align your skills and experience with the JD requirements, identify strengths, and highlight areas to review or prepare.

### Your Strengths (Aligned with JD)

You already have significant overlap with the job requirements, which is a great starting point. Here’s where you shine:

#### Cloud Experience
**JD Requirement:** Good knowledge in cloud service platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure); 2-4 years of DevOps deployment experience in Microsoft Azure, AWS, or GCP.  
**Your Experience:** Extensive AWS experience (EC2, EKS, S3, RDS, VPC, CloudWatch) at NielsenIQ, with Terraform and Ansible for infrastructure automation. You’ve reduced provisioning time by 20% and implemented CloudWatch monitoring with custom metrics.  
**Action:** Be ready to discuss specific AWS services you’ve worked with (e.g., EC2, EKS, S3) and how you’ve optimized them. Mention your Terraform and Ansible usage for Infrastructure as Code (IaC), as it’s explicitly listed in the JD.

#### DevOps Tools (Docker, Kubernetes, CI/CD)
**JD Requirement:** Good knowledge in Docker, Kubernetes; optional knowledge in CI/CD (Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Azure DevOps).  
**Your Experience:** Strong hands-on experience with Docker (containerization) and Kubernetes (orchestration), plus CI/CD pipeline automation using Jenkins and GitLab CI/CD. You’ve reduced deployment times by 25% and errors by 15%.  
**Action:** Prepare examples of how you’ve used Docker and Kubernetes in production (e.g., containerized deployments at NielsenIQ or your personal project). Highlight your Jenkins and GitLab CI/CD pipeline optimizations—specific metrics like 25% reduction in deployment time will impress.

#### Scripting
**JD Requirement:** Good knowledge in Shell scripting; API automation.  
**Your Experience:** Proficient in Shell Scripting, Python, and Groovy for automation, with a 30% performance boost in container management.  
**Action:** Be ready to explain a Shell script you’ve written (e.g., for container management or FTP automation, as per JD). If you’ve done API automation (not explicitly mentioned but implied in your Python work), have an example ready.

#### SQL Databases
**JD Requirement:** Good knowledge in SQL and MongoDB commands and management (backup/restore).  
**Your Experience:** Expertise in Snowflake SQL, Freemarker Templates, and SQL, with a 45% improvement in reporting accuracy. No explicit MongoDB experience mentioned.  
**Action:** Highlight your SQL expertise (Snowflake is a big plus). If asked about MongoDB, say you’re familiar with SQL-based systems and willing to upskill quickly in MongoDB (leverage your quick learning from certifications).

#### Source Control
**JD Requirement:** Practical knowledge in source control management (Git, TFS, Mercurial).  
**Your Experience:** Extensive use of Git, GitHub, and Bitbucket for collaboration and version tracking.  
**Action:** Mention your Git workflows (e.g., branching strategies) and how you’ve ensured team collaboration—tie it to your NielsenIQ role.

#### Linux Administration
**JD Requirement:** Shell scripting on Linux box (implied Linux knowledge).  
**Your Experience:** Proficient in Linux systems administration, performance tuning, and troubleshooting.  
**Action:** Be prepared to discuss Linux commands or a troubleshooting scenario (e.g., optimizing a Jenkins pipeline on Linux).

#### Soft Skills
**JD Requirement:** Excellent team working, communication, organizational, and time management skills; awareness of DevOps and Agile principles.  
**Your Experience:** Mentored junior engineers, partnered with Release Management, and improved team productivity by 15%. Your Agile/DevOps focus is evident in CI/CD and cloud-native approaches.  
**Action:** Prepare a story about mentoring or collaborating with a team under tight deadlines—emphasize Agile/DevOps principles.

### Areas to Brush Up On (Gaps or Less Emphasized Skills)

Here are the areas where the JD requires skills you haven’t explicitly highlighted or may need to review:

#### MongoDB
**JD Requirement:** Good knowledge in MongoDB commands and management (backup/restore).  
**Your Experience:** No MongoDB experience listed; you’ve worked with Snowflake SQL and MySQL.  
**Action:** Quickly review basic MongoDB concepts (e.g., CRUD operations, backup/restore commands). You don’t need mastery—just enough to say, “I haven’t worked with MongoDB directly, but I’m confident in SQL databases like Snowflake and MySQL, and I can adapt quickly.” Mention your Udemy certifications as proof of fast learning.

#### Zookeeper
**JD Requirement:** Develop backend/frontend features in Zookeeper for configuration management.  
**Your Experience:** No Zookeeper experience mentioned.  
**Action:** Zookeeper is a distributed configuration and synchronization service. Skim its basics (e.g., how it manages configurations for distributed systems like Kubernetes). If asked, say you’ve worked with similar tools (e.g., Kubernetes for orchestration) and are eager to learn Zookeeper specifics.

#### FTP Automation on Linux
**JD Requirement:** Write Shell scripts to automate on Linux box for FTP instances.  
**Your Experience:** Shell scripting expertise exists, but no specific FTP automation mentioned.  
**Action:** Review basic FTP commands (e.g., ftp, sftp, curl) and how to script them in Shell (e.g., automating file transfers). Prepare a hypothetical example if you haven’t done this—e.g., “I’d write a script to schedule FTP uploads using cron and sftp with error logging.”

#### Manual Testing Basics
**JD Requirement:** Optional knowledge of basic manual testing.  
**Your Experience:** Not explicitly mentioned, though you’ve tested deployments (implied in CI/CD work).  
**Action:** Brush up on basic testing concepts (e.g., unit vs. integration testing, writing test cases). If asked, tie it to your CI/CD pipeline validation—e.g., “I ensure deployments are error-free by validating pipeline outputs.”

#### Broader Cloud Platforms (Azure/GCP)
**JD Requirement:** Experience in Microsoft Azure, AWS, or GCP.  
**Your Experience:** Strong AWS focus, no Azure or GCP mentioned.  
**Action:** You don’t need deep knowledge, but skim Azure/GCP basics (e.g., Azure DevOps, GCP Compute Engine). If asked, say, “My expertise is in AWS, but I’ve studied Azure/GCP through certifications and can adapt quickly.”

### Specific Topics to Review Tomorrow

Here’s a prioritized list to focus on before your interview:

#### Shell Scripting for FTP (1-2 hours)
Review FTP commands and write a simple Shell script (e.g., automate file upload with error handling). Example:
```bash
#!/bin/bash
HOST='ftp.example.com'
USER='username'
PASS='password'
ftp -n $HOST <<END_SCRIPT
quote USER $USER
quote PASS $PASS
put test.txt
quit
END_SCRIPT
```
Be ready to explain it.

#### MongoDB Basics (1 hour)
Learn basic commands: `db.collection.insert()`, `db.collection.find()`, `mongodump`, `mongorestore`.  
Understand its role in DevOps (e.g., storing CI/CD metadata).

#### Zookeeper Overview (30 minutes)
Read a quick intro (e.g., what it does for configuration management). Relate it to Kubernetes if asked.

#### AWS Deep Dive (1 hour)
Revisit EC2, EKS, S3, RDS, and CloudWatch—prepare a specific example (e.g., setting up CloudWatch alarms in Python).

#### CI/CD Pipeline Example (1 hour)
Rehearse explaining a Jenkins/GitLab pipeline you’ve built—focus on Docker/Kubernetes integration and metrics (e.g., 25% faster deployments).

### Final Tips for the Interview

- **Leverage Metrics:** Your resume is rich with quantifiable achievements (e.g., 20% provisioning reduction, 45% reporting accuracy). Use these to answer behavioral questions (e.g., “Tell me about a time you improved a process”).
- **Show Willingness to Learn:** For gaps (MongoDB, Zookeeper), emphasize your quick learning (e.g., certifications in 2023) and adaptability.
- **Ask Questions:** Show interest—e.g., “What’s the team’s current focus in adopting cloud-native practices?” or “How does Zookeeper fit into your deployment workflows?”

You’re in a strong position with your AWS, Docker, Kubernetes, and CI/CD experience. Focus on the gaps above, and you’ll be well-prepared. Good luck tomorrow! Let me know if you need help with specific examples or mock questions.
