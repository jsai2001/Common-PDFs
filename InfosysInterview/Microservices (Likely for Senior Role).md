### Tips for Your Preparation
- **Leverage Your Resume:** Tie questions to your DevOps, AWS, and containerization experience (e.g., “I’ve used Docker to containerize apps, which I’d apply to Spring Boot microservices”).
- **Practice Coding:** Be ready to write a simple REST controller, configure a Circuit Breaker, or set up a Kafka consumer in Spring Boot.
- **Review Tools:** Quickly revisit Spring Cloud, Resilience4j, and Kafka basics online (e.g., Baeldung tutorials).
- **Mock Answers:** For scenario questions, sketch out architectures or workflows on paper to articulate clearly.

These questions cover the breadth and depth of Spring Boot microservices for a senior role. Focus on understanding concepts and practicing a few examples tonight. Good luck with your interview tomorrow! Let me know if you need help with specific answers or clarifications.
