### Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)

#### Basics and Definitions
1. **What are the four pillars of OOP, and how do they work in Java?**
   - *Answer:* The four pillars are Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction. Encapsulation bundles data and methods into a class, protecting data with access modifiers (e.g., `private`) and exposing it via getters/setters. Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another using `extends` (e.g., a `Car` class extending `Vehicle`). Polymorphism enables one interface to represent multiple forms, achieved via method overriding or overloading. Abstraction hides complexity, implemented through `abstract` classes or `interface`s, letting users focus on "what" instead of "how."
   - *Example:* In Java, `public class Patient { private String name; public String getName() { return name; } }` shows encapsulation.

2. **Explain encapsulation with a real-world example from your projects.**
   - *Answer:* Encapsulation is about hiding data and exposing only necessary methods. In my Doctor-Patient System, I could encapsulate patient data like `patientId` and `appointmentTime` in a `Patient` class with `private` fields and public getters/setters. This ensured the front-end (HTML/JS) couldn’t directly manipulate sensitive data, only interact via controlled methods, improving security and maintainability.
   - *Code Snippet:*
     ```java
     public class Patient {
         private String patientId;
         private LocalDateTime appointmentTime;

         public String getPatientId() { return patientId; }
         public void setPatientId(String patientId) { this.patientId = patientId; }
         public LocalDateTime getAppointmentTime() { return appointmentTime; }
         public void setAppointmentTime(LocalDateTime time) { this.appointmentTime = time; }
     }
     ```

3. **How does inheritance differ from polymorphism in Java?**
   - *Answer:* Inheritance is a mechanism where a subclass inherits fields and methods from a superclass (e.g., `class Car extends Vehicle`), promoting code reuse. Polymorphism allows objects of different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass or interface, enabling flexibility via method overriding or overloading. Inheritance is about structure; polymorphism is about behavior.
   - *Example:* A `Doctor` class might inherit from `Person`, while polymorphism lets me call `treatPatient()` on a `Doctor` or `Nurse` via a `HealthcareProvider` interface.

4. **What is abstraction, and how is it achieved in Java?**
   - *Answer:* Abstraction hides implementation details and exposes only essential features. In Java, it’s achieved using `abstract` classes (partial implementation) or `interface`s (pure contract). For example, in my Doctor-Patient System, I could define an `interface AppointmentManager` with a method `schedule()`, implemented differently by `Doctor` and `Patient` classes.
   - *Code Snippet:*
     ```java
     public interface AppointmentManager {
         void schedule(LocalDateTime time);
     }
     public class Doctor implements AppointmentManager {
         public void schedule(LocalDateTime time) { System.out.println("Doctor scheduled at " + time); }
     }
     ```

#### Practical Applications
5. **Can you provide an example from your experience where you used encapsulation to protect data?**
   - *Answer:* At NielsenIQ, I automated container management with Python scripts. If I’d used Java, I’d encapsulate container details (e.g., `containerId`, `status`) in a `Container` class with `private` fields and public methods like `startContainer()`. This would prevent direct access to `status`, ensuring changes go through controlled logic, reducing errors.

6. **How have you implemented inheritance in a past project? What was the benefit?**
   - *Answer:* In my Doctor-Patient System, I could use inheritance by creating a `User` superclass with fields like `name` and `id`, then extending it to `Doctor` and `Patient` subclasses. The benefit was code reuse—common methods like `login()` stayed in `User`, reducing duplication and making maintenance easier.

7. **Describe a scenario where you used polymorphism to make your code more flexible.**
   - *Answer:* In a hypothetical Spring Boot refactor of my Doctor-Patient System, I’d define an `interface NotificationSender` with a `send()` method. Classes like `EmailSender` and `SMSSender` would implement it differently. This polymorphism lets me switch notification types without changing the calling code, enhancing flexibility.

8. **How would you design a class hierarchy for a system like your "Doctor-Patient Interaction" project?**
   - *Answer:* I’d start with an abstract `User` class (with `id`, `name`, `login()`), extended by `Doctor` (adding `specialty`, `schedule()`) and `Patient` (adding `medicalHistory`, `bookAppointment()`). An `interface AppointmentHandler` would define `confirmAppointment()`, implemented by both. This balances reuse (inheritance) and flexibility (abstraction).

#### Advanced Concepts
9. **What’s the difference between an abstract class and an interface in Java? When would you use one over the other?**
   - *Answer:* An `abstract` class can have both abstract and concrete methods, plus fields, while an `interface` (pre-Java 8) only had abstract methods, now with `default` methods. Use an abstract class when you need shared implementation (e.g., `User` with `login()`), and an interface for a pure contract (e.g., `NotificationSender`). In my project, I’d use an abstract `User` for common logic and an interface for pluggable behaviors.

10. **How does Java handle multiple inheritance, and how do you work around its limitations?**
    - *Answer:* Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance of classes to avoid the diamond problem, but it allows multiple `interface` implementations. I’d work around it by using interfaces with `default` methods (Java 8+). For example, a `Doctor` could implement `AppointmentHandler` and `PrescriptionWriter`, delegating conflicts explicitly.

11. **Explain the "diamond problem" in OOP and how Java 8+ resolves it with default methods.**
    - *Answer:* The diamond problem occurs when a class inherits from two classes that inherit from a common base, causing ambiguity (e.g., which method to use?). Java avoids this with single-class inheritance. With interfaces, Java 8+ `default` methods might conflict if implemented by multiple interfaces; you resolve it by overriding the method in the implementing class and explicitly calling the desired interface’s method using `InterfaceName.super.method()`.

12. **Can you write a small code snippet demonstrating runtime polymorphism?**
    - *Answer:* Here’s an example:
      ```java
      abstract class Vehicle {
          abstract void move();
      }
      class Car extends Vehicle {
          void move() { System.out.println("Car drives"); }
      }
      class Bike extends Vehicle {
          void move() { System.out.println("Bike rides"); }
      }
      public class Test {
          public static void main(String[] args) {
              Vehicle v = new Car(); // Runtime polymorphism
              v.move(); // Outputs: "Car drives"
              v = new Bike();
              v.move(); // Outputs: "Bike rides"
          }
      }
      ```

#### Coding Challenges
13. **Write a Java program to model a "Vehicle" superclass and "Car" and "Bike" subclasses, showcasing inheritance and polymorphism.**
    - *Answer:*
      ```java
      abstract class Vehicle {
          protected String brand;
          public Vehicle(String brand) { this.brand = brand; }
          abstract void move();
      }
      class Car extends Vehicle {
          public Car(String brand) { super(brand); }
          void move() { System.out.println(brand + " car drives smoothly"); }
      }
      class Bike extends Vehicle {
          public Bike(String brand) { super(brand); }
          void move() { System.out.println(brand + " bike rides fast"); }
      }
      public class Main {
          public static void main(String[] args) {
              Vehicle vehicle = new Car("Toyota");
              vehicle.move(); // "Toyota car drives smoothly"
              vehicle = new Bike("Honda");
              vehicle.move(); // "Honda bike rides fast"
          }
      }
      ```

14. **Design a class with private fields, getters/setters, and explain how this enforces encapsulation.**
    - *Answer:* Here’s a `Patient` class:
      ```java
      public class Patient {
          private String patientId;
          private String name;

          public Patient(String patientId, String name) {
              this.patientId = patientId;
              this.name = name;
          }
          public String getPatientId() { return patientId; }
          public void setPatientId(String patientId) { this.patientId = patientId; }
          public String getName() { return name; }
          public void setName(String name) { this.name = name; }
      }
      ```
      - *Explanation:* Private fields (`patientId`, `name`) prevent direct access, forcing external code to use getters/setters. This controls how data is read or modified, ensuring validation (e.g., `setPatientId` could check format) and protecting integrity.

### Collections Framework

#### Core Concepts
15. **What is the Java Collections Framework, and what are its main interfaces?**
    - *Answer:* The Java Collections Framework is a set of classes and interfaces for storing and manipulating groups of objects. Main interfaces are `List` (ordered, allows duplicates, e.g., `ArrayList`), `Set` (unordered, no duplicates, e.g., `HashSet`), and `Map` (key-value pairs, e.g., `HashMap`).

16. **Explain the difference between `List`, `Set`, and `Map`.**
    - *Answer:* `List` maintains insertion order and allows duplicates (e.g., `ArrayList` for patient appointments). `Set` ensures uniqueness, no order (e.g., `HashSet` for unique doctor IDs). `Map` stores key-value pairs, no duplicate keys (e.g., `HashMap` for patient ID to appointment).

17. **How does `ArrayList` differ from `LinkedList` in terms of performance and use cases?**
    - *Answer:* `ArrayList` uses a dynamic array, offering O(1) random access but slow O(n) insertions/deletions in the middle. `LinkedList` uses a doubly-linked list, with O(1) insertions/deletions but O(n) access. Use `ArrayList` for frequent reads (e.g., patient list), `LinkedList` for frequent updates (e.g., queue of tasks).

18. **What’s the difference between `HashMap`, `TreeMap`, and `LinkedHashMap`?**
    - *Answer:* `HashMap` is unordered, O(1) get/put (e.g., quick lookups). `TreeMap` is sorted by keys, O(log n) operations (e.g., ordered patient IDs). `LinkedHashMap` preserves insertion order, O(1) with extra overhead (e.g., tracking sequence of appointments).

#### Performance and Use Cases
19. **When would you choose `HashSet` over `TreeSet` in a project?**
    - *Answer:* I’d use `HashSet` for faster O(1) lookups when order doesn’t matter (e.g., unique patient IDs). `TreeSet` is better when I need sorted data, like a list of appointments by time, at O(log n) cost.

20. **How does `HashMap` handle collisions, and what’s its time complexity for get/put operations?**
    - *Answer:* `HashMap` uses hashing; collisions are resolved with linked lists (or trees in Java 8+ if many collisions). Average time complexity is O(1) for get/put, degrading to O(n) or O(log n) with many collisions.

21. **In your NielsenIQ projects, how might you have used a `Map` to optimize data processing?**
    - *Answer:* In my real-time data aggregation system, I could’ve used a `HashMap` to cache query results (e.g., `queryId` to `resultSet`), reducing redundant Snowflake SQL calls and speeding up reporting by 20%.

22. **What’s the performance impact of using synchronized collections like `Collections.synchronizedList`?**
    - *Answer:* It adds thread safety by locking the entire list, but this can cause contention, slowing performance in high-concurrency scenarios. I’d prefer `CopyOnWriteArrayList` for read-heavy cases or `ConcurrentHashMap` for maps.

#### Practical Scenarios
23. **How would you store and retrieve patient appointment data efficiently using a Collection?**
    - *Answer:* I’d use a `HashMap<String, List<Appointment>>`, mapping `patientId` to a `List` of their appointments. Fast O(1) retrieval by ID, with `ArrayList` for ordered appointment history.

24. **Describe a situation where you had to choose between `ArrayList` and `HashSet`. Why?**
    - *Answer:* In my Doctor-Patient System, I’d use `ArrayList` for a doctor’s appointment list to preserve order and allow duplicates (multiple slots at the same time). I’d use `HashSet` for a unique set of patient IDs to ensure no repeats.

25. **How do you iterate over a `HashMap` in Java, and what’s the most efficient way?**
    - *Answer:* Use `entrySet()` for efficiency as it avoids separate key lookups:
      ```java
      HashMap<String, String> map = new HashMap<>();
      map.put("1", "A"); map.put("2", "B");
      for (Map.Entry<String, String> entry : map.entrySet()) {
          System.out.println(entry.getKey() + ": " + entry.getValue());
      }
      ```

#### Coding Challenges
26. **Write a program to remove duplicates from an `ArrayList` using a `Set`.**
    - *Answer:*
      ```java
      import java.util.*;
      public class Main {
          public static void main(String[] args) {
              ArrayList<String> list = new ArrayList<>(Arrays.asList("A", "B", "A", "C"));
              Set<String> set = new HashSet<>(list);
              list.clear();
              list.addAll(set);
              System.out.println(list); // [A, B, C]
          }
      }
      ```

27. **Implement a method to find the most frequent element in a `List` using a `Map`.**
    - *Answer:*
      ```java
      import java.util.*;
      public class Main {
          public static String findMostFrequent(List<String> list) {
              Map<String, Integer> freq = new HashMap<>();
              for (String s : list) {
                  freq.put(s, freq.getOrDefault(s, 0) + 1);
              }
              return Collections.max(freq.entrySet(), Map.Entry.comparingByValue()).getKey();
          }
          public static void main(String[] args) {
              List<String> list = Arrays.asList("A", "B", "A", "C", "A");
              System.out.println(findMostFrequent(list)); // A
          }
      }
      ```

28. **Sort a `List` of custom objects (e.g., "Patient") by a field like "appointmentTime" using `Comparator`.**
    - *Answer:*
      ```java
      import java.time.LocalDateTime;
      import java.util.*;
      class Patient {
          String name;
          LocalDateTime appointmentTime;
          Patient(String name, LocalDateTime time) { this.name = name; this.appointmentTime = time; }
          public LocalDateTime getAppointmentTime() { return appointmentTime; }
          public String toString() { return name + ": " + appointmentTime; }
      }
      public class Main {
          public static void main(String[] args) {
              List<Patient> patients = new ArrayList<>();
              patients.add(new Patient("John", LocalDateTime.parse("2025-03-29T10:00")));
              patients.add(new Patient("Alice", LocalDateTime.parse("2025-03-29T09:00")));
              Collections.sort(patients, Comparator.comparing(Patient::getAppointmentTime));
              patients.forEach(System.out::println); // Alice: 2025-03-29T09:00, John: 2025-03-29T10:00
          }
      }
      ```

### Exception Handling

#### Fundamentals
29. **What’s the difference between `checked` and `unchecked` exceptions in Java?**
    - *Answer:* Checked exceptions (e.g., `IOException`) must be handled or declared with `throws`, enforced at compile time. Unchecked exceptions (e.g., `NullPointerException`, subclasses of `RuntimeException`) don’t require explicit handling, occurring at runtime due to logic errors.

30. **Explain the hierarchy of exception classes in Java (e.g., `Throwable`, `Error`, `Exception`).**
    - *Answer:* `Throwable` is the root, with two subclasses: `Error` (e.g., `OutOfMemoryError`, unrecoverable system issues) and `Exception` (e.g., `IOException`, recoverable application issues). `RuntimeException` is a key subclass of `Exception` for unchecked exceptions.

31. **What’s the purpose of the `finally` block? When might it not execute?**
    - *Answer:* `finally` executes after `try`/`catch`, ensuring cleanup (e.g., closing resources). It might not run if `System.exit()` is called, an infinite loop occurs, or the JVM crashes.

#### Best Practices
32. **How do you decide whether to catch an exception or propagate it up the call stack?**
    - *Answer:* I catch it if I can handle it meaningfully (e.g., retry a failed connection). I propagate it if the caller has more context to decide (e.g., a service layer throwing to a controller in Spring Boot).

33. **What’s the advantage of creating custom exceptions in a project?**
    - *Answer:* Custom exceptions provide specific error context, improving debugging and user feedback. For example, `InvalidPatientIdException` in my system would clarify the issue over a generic `Exception`.

34. **How do you handle multiple exceptions in a single `try` block?**
    - *Answer:* Use multiple `catch` blocks or a multi-catch with `|` (Java 7+):
      ```java
      try {
          // Risky code
      } catch (IOException | SQLException e) {
          System.out.println("Error: " + e.getMessage());
      }
      ```

#### Practical Experience
35. **Can you share an example from your work where you implemented exception handling to improve reliability?**
    - *Answer:* At NielsenIQ, my Python automation scripts for Docker occasionally failed due to network issues. In Java, I’d wrap container start calls in a `try-catch` for `IOException`, retrying up to 3 times, ensuring deployments didn’t fail silently.

36. **How would you handle a database connection failure in your "Doctor-Patient" system?**
    - *Answer:* I’d use a `try-catch` around the MySQL connection, catching `SQLException`, logging the error, and retrying with exponential backoff. If it fails after retries, I’d throw a custom `DatabaseUnavailableException` to the caller.

37. **What’s your approach to logging exceptions in a production environment?**
    - *Answer:* I’d use a logging framework like SLF4J with Logback in Spring Boot, logging the stack trace at `ERROR` level for debugging, and a user-friendly message at `INFO` level for monitoring.

#### Coding Challenges
38. **Write a method that throws a custom exception if a patient ID is invalid.**
    - *Answer:*

### Multithreading and Concurrency

#### Core Concepts
41. **What’s the difference between a process and a thread in Java?**
    - *Answer:* A process is an independent program with its own memory space (e.g., a JVM instance). A thread is a lightweight unit within a process, sharing memory. Java creates threads for concurrency within the same application.

42. **How do you create a thread in Java? Compare `Thread` class vs. `Runnable` interface.**
    - *Answer:* Extend `Thread` and override `run()`, or implement `Runnable` and pass it to a `Thread`. `Runnable` is preferred because it allows separation of task logic from thread management and supports single inheritance.
      ```java
      class MyThread extends Thread {
          public void run() { System.out.println("Thread running"); }
      }
      class MyRunnable implements Runnable {
          public void run() { System.out.println("Runnable running"); }
      }
      ```

43. **What is the `ExecutorService`, and how does it simplify thread management?**
    - *Answer:* `ExecutorService` manages a pool of threads, abstracting thread creation and reuse. It simplifies concurrency by handling lifecycle, task queuing, and shutdown (e.g., `Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5)`).

44. **Explain the role of the `synchronized` keyword in Java.**
    - *Answer:* `synchronized` ensures only one thread accesses a block or method at a time, preventing race conditions. For example, synchronizing a counter increment ensures thread safety.

#### Advanced Topics
45. **What are the benefits of using `java.util.concurrent` over traditional threading?**
    - *Answer:* It offers high-level abstractions like `ExecutorService`, `ThreadPoolExecutor`, and `CompletableFuture`, reducing boilerplate, improving scalability, and providing utilities like `Lock` and `Atomic` classes.

46. **How does a `ThreadPool` work, and why is it useful in a Spring Boot application?**
    - *Answer:* A `ThreadPool` reuses a fixed number of threads to execute tasks, avoiding overhead of thread creation. In Spring Boot, it’s useful for handling concurrent HTTP requests efficiently via `@Async`.

47. **What’s the difference between `Callable` and `Runnable`? How do you use `Future` with them?**
    - *Answer:* `Runnable` runs a task with no return value; `Callable` returns a result and can throw exceptions. `Future` retrieves the `Callable` result asynchronously:
      ```java
      Callable<String> callable = () -> "Done";
      ExecutorService executor = Executors.newSingleThreadExecutor();
      Future<String> future = executor.submit(callable);
      ```

48. **Explain the `volatile` keyword and its use in multithreading.**
    - *Answer:* `volatile` ensures a variable’s value is always read from/written to main memory, not thread-local caches, preventing visibility issues in multithreading. It’s lighter than `synchronized` for single-variable access.

#### Practical Scenarios
49. **How would you handle concurrent appointment bookings in your "Doctor-Patient" system?**
    - *Answer:* I’d use a `synchronized` block or `ReentrantLock` on the doctor’s schedule to prevent double-booking, or a `ConcurrentHashMap` mapping doctor IDs to appointment slots for thread-safe updates.

50. **Describe a time when you debugged a race condition or deadlock in your code.**
    - *Answer:* At NielsenIQ, my Python container scripts occasionally overlapped resource allocation. In Java, I’d simulate this with threads incrementing a shared counter without `synchronized`, then fix it by adding synchronization.

51. **How might you use `CompletableFuture` to process multiple API calls asynchronously?**
    - *Answer:* I’d use `CompletableFuture` to fetch patient data and doctor availability concurrently:
      ```java
      CompletableFuture<String> patientData = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Patient fetched");
      CompletableFuture<String> doctorData = CompletableFuture.supplyAsync(() -> "Doctor fetched");
      CompletableFuture.allOf(patientData, doctorData).join();
      ```

#### Coding Challenges
52. **Write a program using `ExecutorService` to process 5 tasks concurrently.**
    - *Answer:*
      ```java
      import java.util.concurrent.*;
      public class Main {
          public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
              ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(5);
              for (int i = 1; i <= 5; i++) {
                  int taskId = i;
                  executor.submit(() -> System.out.println("Task " + taskId + " by " + Thread.currentThread().getName()));
              }
              executor.shutdown();
              executor.awaitTermination(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
          }
      }
      ```

53. **Implement a thread-safe counter using `synchronized` or `AtomicInteger`.**
    - *Answer:*
      ```java
      import java.util.concurrent.atomic.AtomicInteger;
      public class Counter {
          private AtomicInteger count = new AtomicInteger(0);
          public void increment() { count.incrementAndGet(); }
          public int getCount() { return count.get(); }
          public static void main(String[] args) throws Exception {
              Counter counter = new Counter();
              ExecutorService executor = Executors.newFixedThreadPool(2);
              executor.submit(() -> { for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) counter.increment(); });
              executor.submit(() -> { for (int i = 0; i < 1000; i++) counter.increment(); });
              executor.shutdown();
              executor.awaitTermination(5, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
              System.out.println("Count: " + counter.getCount()); // 2000
          }
      }
      ```

54. **Simulate a producer-consumer problem using `wait()` and `notify()`.**
    - *Answer:*
      ```java
      import java.util.LinkedList;
      public class Main {
          LinkedList<Integer> queue = new LinkedList<>();
          int capacity = 2;
          public synchronized void produce(int item) throws InterruptedException {
              while (queue.size() == capacity) wait();
              queue.add(item);
              System.out.println("Produced: " + item);
              notify();
          }
          public synchronized int consume() throws InterruptedException {
              while (queue.isEmpty()) wait();
              int item = queue.removeFirst();
              System.out.println("Consumed: " + item);
              notify();
              return item;
          }
          public static void main(String[] args) {
              Main pc = new Main();
              new Thread(() -> { for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) try { pc.produce(i); } catch (Exception e) {} }).start();
              new Thread(() -> { for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) try { pc.consume(); } catch (Exception e) {} }).start();
          }
      }
      ```

### Java 8+ Features

#### Lambda Expressions
55. **What are lambda expressions, and how do they improve code readability?**
    - *Answer:* Lambda expressions are anonymous functions (e.g., `(x) -> x * 2`), introduced in Java 8. They simplify code by replacing verbose anonymous classes, making it concise and readable, especially with functional interfaces like `Runnable`.

56. **How would you rewrite a `Runnable` implementation using a lambda?**
    - *Answer:*
      ```java
      // Traditional
      Runnable r1 = new Runnable() {
          public void run() { System.out.println("Running"); }
      };
      // Lambda
      Runnable r2 = () -> System.out.println("Running");
      ```

57. **What’s the syntax of a lambda expression, and what are functional interfaces?**
    - *Answer:* Syntax: `(parameters) -> expression` or `(parameters) -> { statements; }`. Functional interfaces have one abstract method (e.g., `Runnable`, `Comparator`), enabling lambdas as their implementations.

#### Streams API
58. **What’s the difference between a `Stream` and a `Collection` in Java?**
    - *Answer:* A `Collection` stores data (e.g., `List`), while a `Stream` processes data lazily, enabling operations like filtering or mapping without modifying the source.

59. **Explain the difference between `map()` and `flatMap()` with examples.**
    - *Answer:* `map()` transforms each element into one output (1:1), while `flatMap()` flattens nested structures (1:many). Example:
      ```java
      List<String> list = Arrays.asList("a", "b");
      list.stream().map(String::toUpperCase).forEach(System.out::println); // A, B
      List<List<String>> nested = Arrays.asList(Arrays.asList("a"), Arrays.asList("b"));
      nested.stream().flatMap(Collection::stream).forEach(System.out::println); // a, b
      ```

60. **How do you handle exceptions in a Stream pipeline?**
    - *Answer:* Wrap the operation in a `try-catch` within a lambda or use a utility method:
      ```java
      Stream.of("1", "a", "2").map(s -> {
          try { return Integer.parseInt(s); } catch (NumberFormatException e) { return 0; }
      }).forEach(System.out::println); // 1, 0, 2
      ```

#### Optional
61. **What problem does `Optional` solve, and how does it prevent `NullPointerException`?**
    - *Answer:* `Optional` handles potentially null values, encouraging explicit null checks over blind dereferencing, reducing `NullPointerException`. Example: `Optional.ofNullable(user).orElse(defaultUser)`.

62. **How would you refactor a null-check-heavy method using `Optional`?**
    - *Answer:* Before: `if (user != null) return user.getName(); else return "Unknown";`
      After:
      ```java
      return Optional.ofNullable(user).map(User::getName).orElse("Unknown");
      ```

63. **What are the key methods of `Optional` (e.g., `orElse`, `ifPresent`)?**
    - *Answer:* `orElse()` provides a default if empty, `ifPresent()` executes a lambda if value exists, `map()` transforms the value, `orElseThrow()` throws an exception if empty.

#### Practical Applications
64. **How might you use Streams to filter and process patient data in your project?**
    - *Answer:* I’d filter patients with upcoming appointments:
      ```java
      List<Patient> patients = // ...;
      patients.stream()
              .filter(p -> p.getAppointmentTime().isAfter(LocalDateTime.now()))
              .forEach(System.out::println);
      ```

65. **Can you give an example from your NielsenIQ work where Java 8+ features improved efficiency?**
    - *Answer:* My Python data aggregation could use Streams in Java to process results: `results.stream().collect(Collectors.groupingBy(Result::getCategory))`, reducing manual loops and improving readability.

66. **How do lambdas and Streams integrate with Spring Boot (e.g., in controllers or services)?**
    - *Answer:* In a `@RestController`, I’d use Streams to process data: `patients.stream().map(PatientDTO::new).collect(Collectors.toList())` for a response, or lambdas in `@Async` methods for background tasks.

#### Coding Challenges
67. **Write a lambda expression to sort a list of strings by length.**
    - *Answer:*
      ```java
      List<String> list = Arrays.asList("cat", "elephant", "dog");
      list.sort((s1, s2) -> s1.length() - s2.length());
      System.out.println(list); // [cat, dog, elephant]
      ```

68. **Use Streams to find the average age of patients from a `List<Patient>`.**
    - *Answer:*
      ```java
      class Patient {
          int age;
          Patient(int age) { this.age = age; }
          int getAge() { return age; }
      }
      List<Patient> patients = Arrays.asList(new Patient(30), new Patient(40), new Patient(50));
      double avg = patients.stream().mapToInt(Patient::getAge).average().orElse(0.0);
      System.out.println(avg); // 40.0
      ```

69. **Refactor a nested loop into a Stream pipeline for cleaner code.**
    - *Answer:* Before:
      ```java
      List<String> result = new ArrayList<>();
      for (String s : Arrays.asList("a", "b")) {
          for (int i = 1; i <= 2; i++) {
              result.add(s + i);
          }
      }
      ```
      After:
      ```java
      List<String> result = Stream.of("a", "b")
              .flatMap(s -> Stream.of(1, 2).map(i -> s + i))
              .collect(Collectors.toList());
      System.out.println(result); // [a1, a2, b1, b2]
      ```

### General and Behavioral Questions

#### Experience-Based
70. **How have you used OOP principles in your NielsenIQ projects?**
    - *Answer:* My Python automation scripts followed OOP by encapsulating container logic in classes. In Java, I’d use inheritance (e.g., `BaseAutomation` → `ContainerAutomation`) and polymorphism for flexible task execution.

71. **Have you ever optimized a Java collection for better performance? What was the outcome?**
    - *Answer:* In a hypothetical NielsenIQ Java port, I’d replace a `List` with a `HashSet` for unique container IDs, reducing lookup time from O(n) to O(1), speeding up checks by 20%.

72. **Describe a challenging multithreading issue you faced and how you resolved it.**
    - *Answer:* In a Python script, concurrent container starts caused overlap. In Java, I’d use `ExecutorService` with a fixed pool, ensuring controlled execution and no resource conflicts.

#### Design and Problem-Solving
73. **How would you design a thread-safe appointment scheduling system?**
    - *Answer:* I’d use a `ConcurrentHashMap<DoctorId, List<Appointment>>` with `synchronized` blocks or `Lock` for slot booking, ensuring atomic updates across threads.

74. **What’s your approach to choosing the right Collection for a given problem?**
    - *Answer:* I consider access patterns: `List` for ordered data, `Set` for uniqueness, `Map` for key-value pairs. For performance, I’d benchmark `ArrayList` vs. `LinkedList` or `HashMap` vs. `TreeMap`.

75. **How do you ensure your Java code is robust against exceptions in a production environment?**
    - *Answer:* I use specific `catch` blocks, custom exceptions for clarity, logging with SLF4J, and fallback logic (e.g., `Optional`) to gracefully handle failures.

#### Senior-Level Focus
76. **How would you mentor a junior developer on Java concurrency best practices?**
    - *Answer:* I’d explain `synchronized` vs. `Lock`, demo `ExecutorService` for thread pools, and walk through a deadlock scenario, emphasizing testing with tools like JVisualVM.

77. **What strategies do you use to keep up with Java’s evolving features (e.g., Java 17+)?**
    - *Answer:* I follow Oracle’s release notes, experiment with new features (e.g., records, sealed classes) in side projects, and take Udemy courses, like my DevOps certifications.

78. **How do you balance performance and readability when using Java 8+ features?**
    - *Answer:* I use Streams for readability but avoid overcomplicating with nested operations. For performance, I profile with tools like VisualVM to ensure efficiency, favoring clarity unless optimization is critical.
