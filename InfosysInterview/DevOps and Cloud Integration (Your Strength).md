### CI/CD with Spring Boot

#### General Concepts
1. **What is CI/CD, and why is it important for Spring Boot application development?**
   - **Answer:** CI/CD stands for Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment. It’s a practice where code changes are frequently integrated, tested, and deployed automatically. For Spring Boot, it’s critical because it ensures rapid feedback on code quality through automated builds and tests, reduces deployment errors with consistent pipelines, and accelerates delivery of features like REST APIs or microservices. It aligns with Spring Boot’s focus on developer productivity by automating repetitive tasks like packaging JARs or deploying to cloud environments.

2. **How do you integrate a Spring Boot application into a CI/CD pipeline?**
   - **Answer:** I’d start by versioning the code in Git, triggering a pipeline on commits. The pipeline would use Maven to build the Spring Boot app (`mvn package`), run unit tests with JUnit, and package it into a JAR. Next, I’d build a Docker image with the JAR, push it to a registry like Docker Hub, and deploy it to a Kubernetes cluster or AWS EC2. Tools like Jenkins or GitHub Actions would orchestrate this, with environment-specific configs managed via Spring profiles (`application-dev.yml`).

3. **What tools have you used to build CI/CD pipelines, and why did you choose Jenkins and GitHub Actions?**
   - **Answer:** I’ve used Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Maven extensively. At NielsenIQ, I chose Jenkins for its flexibility in scripting complex workflows with Groovy and its plugin ecosystem, which supported our AWS and Kubernetes integrations. GitHub Actions was great for simpler, Git-integrated pipelines, offering reusable workflows and a cloud-hosted setup that reduced maintenance. Both tools ensured reliable builds and deployments, tailored to project needs.

4. **How does Maven fit into a CI/CD pipeline for a Spring Boot project?**
   - **Answer:** Maven manages dependencies, builds, and packaging for Spring Boot. In a CI/CD pipeline, it resolves libraries like Spring Boot Starter via `pom.xml`, compiles the code, runs tests, and generates a JAR (`mvn package`). I’ve used it at NielsenIQ to optimize build consistency by caching dependencies and enforcing version control, ensuring the pipeline produces repeatable artifacts for Docker or direct deployment.

   - **Code Snippet (pom.xml excerpt):**
     ```xml
     <dependency>
         <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
         <artifactId>spring-boot-starter-web</artifactId>
         <version>3.2.4</version>
     </dependency>
     <build>
         <plugins>
             <plugin>
                 <groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
                 <artifactId>spring-boot-maven-plugin</artifactId>
             </plugin>
         </plugins>
     </build>
     ```

5. **What are the key differences between Jenkins and GitHub Actions for managing Spring Boot builds?**
   - **Answer:** Jenkins is a self-hosted, highly customizable tool with a steep learning curve but offers deep control via plugins and Groovy scripts—ideal for complex Spring Boot pipelines with AWS or Kubernetes. GitHub Actions is cloud-hosted, simpler to set up with YAML workflows, and tightly integrated with GitHub, making it faster for smaller Spring Boot projects. Jenkins excels in enterprise setups; GitHub Actions shines for agility.

#### Pipeline Design
6. **Can you walk us through how you’d set up a Jenkins pipeline for a Spring Boot application from code commit to deployment?**
   - **Answer:** I’d configure a `Jenkinsfile` with stages: First, *Checkout* pulls the code from Git. *Build* runs `mvn clean package` to compile and test the Spring Boot app. *Dockerize* builds a Docker image with the JAR and pushes it to a registry. *Deploy* uses `kubectl` to roll out the image to a Kubernetes cluster, with environment variables from Spring profiles. At NielsenIQ, I added a *Test* stage with integration tests, reducing deployment errors by 15%.

   - **Code Snippet (Jenkinsfile excerpt):**
     ```groovy
     pipeline {
         agent any
         stages {
             stage('Build') {
                 steps {
                     sh 'mvn clean package'
                 }
             }
             stage('Dockerize') {
                 steps {
                     sh 'docker build -t spring-app:latest .'
                     sh 'docker push spring-app:latest'
                 }
             }
             stage('Deploy') {
                 steps {
                     sh 'kubectl apply -f k8s-deployment.yaml'
                 }
             }
         }
     }
     ```

7. **How do you configure GitHub Actions to build, test, and deploy a Spring Boot app?**
   - **Answer:** I’d create a `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` file. It triggers on `push` to `main`, sets up Java and Maven, builds the app with `mvn package`, runs tests, builds a Docker image, and deploys it to AWS EKS. I’d use secrets for credentials. This mirrors my NielsenIQ setup, where GitHub Actions streamlined deployments.

   - **Code Snippet (GitHub Actions YAML):**
     ```yaml
     name: Deploy Spring Boot
     on: [push]
     jobs:
       build:
         runs-on: ubuntu-latest
         steps:
           - uses: actions/checkout@v3
           - uses: actions/setup-java@v3
             with: { java-version: '17' }
           - run: mvn clean package
           - run: docker build -t spring-app .
           - run: docker push spring-app
     ```

8. **What stages would you include in a CI/CD pipeline for a Spring Boot microservice?**
   - **Answer:** I’d include: 1) *Checkout* to fetch code, 2) *Build* with `mvn package`, 3) *Unit Test* using JUnit, 4) *Integration Test* with Spring Boot Test, 5) *Docker Build* to containerize, 6) *Push* to a registry, 7) *Deploy* to Kubernetes, and 8) *Verify* with health checks via Actuator. This ensures quality and reliability, as I did at NielsenIQ.

9. **How do you handle automated testing (unit, integration) in your CI/CD pipeline for Spring Boot?**
   - **Answer:** For unit tests, I use JUnit and Mockito in the *Build* stage (`mvn test`) to validate business logic. For integration tests, I leverage Spring Boot Test with an in-memory DB like H2 in a separate stage, mocking external services. At NielsenIQ, this caught issues early, reducing deployment errors by 15%.

10. **How do you ensure environment-specific configurations (e.g., dev, prod) in your pipeline?**
    - **Answer:** I use Spring Boot’s profiles (`application-dev.yml`, `application-prod.yml`) and pass the active profile via environment variables in the pipeline. In Jenkins, I’d set `SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=prod` during deployment. At NielsenIQ, I synced these with Kubernetes ConfigMaps, ensuring seamless transitions across environments.

#### Practical Experience
11. **You mentioned reducing deployment time by 25% with Jenkins at NielsenIQ. How did you achieve this with Spring Boot or similar apps?**
    - **Answer:** At NielsenIQ, I optimized Jenkins pipelines by parallelizing build and test stages, caching Maven dependencies, and using Docker for consistent environments. For a Spring Boot context, this would translate to faster JAR builds and container deployments, cutting time from code commit to production.

12. **How do you use Maven to optimize build consistency in a Spring Boot project?**
    - **Answer:** I define all dependencies in `pom.xml` with fixed versions, use the Spring Boot Maven plugin to package the app, and cache the `.m2` repository in the pipeline. At NielsenIQ, this eliminated version mismatches, ensuring every build produced identical artifacts.

13. **Have you ever encountered a pipeline failure with Jenkins or GitHub Actions? How did you debug and resolve it?**
    - **Answer:** Yes, at NielsenIQ, a Jenkins pipeline failed due to a Docker image push error. I checked logs, found an authentication issue with the registry, updated credentials in Jenkins, and added a retry step. For Spring Boot, I’d ensure the JAR builds correctly first, then debug containerization.

14. **How do you version Spring Boot artifacts in a CI/CD pipeline (e.g., Maven versioning)?**
    - **Answer:** I use Maven’s `version` in `pom.xml` (e.g., `1.0.0-SNAPSHOT`) and increment it with `mvn versions:set`. In the pipeline, I tag Docker images with the same version (e.g., `spring-app:1.0.0`). At NielsenIQ, this synced app and image versions, reducing misalignments by 30%.

15. **What strategies do you use to minimize deployment errors, as you did by 15% in your role?**
    - **Answer:** I enforce automated tests, use Docker for consistent environments, and implement health checks. At NielsenIQ, I added integration tests and container rollbacks, which I’d replicate in Spring Boot with Actuator endpoints and Kubernetes readiness probes.

#### Scenario-Based
16. **Suppose a Spring Boot app fails to deploy due to a dependency conflict in the pipeline. How would you troubleshoot it?**
    - **Answer:** I’d check the Maven build logs for dependency errors, run `mvn dependency:tree` to identify conflicts, and resolve them by excluding or updating versions in `pom.xml`. Then, I’d rebuild and test locally before pushing the fix to the pipeline.

17. **How would you set up a rollback mechanism in a Jenkins pipeline for a Spring Boot app?**
    - **Answer:** I’d store the previous Docker image tag in Jenkins, and if deployment fails (e.g., health check fails), I’d trigger a rollback stage with `kubectl rollout undo`. At NielsenIQ, I used similar logic with Kubernetes, ensuring zero downtime.

18. **If a team member pushes a breaking change, how would your CI/CD pipeline catch it before deployment?**
    - **Answer:** My pipeline would run unit and integration tests in early stages. For Spring Boot, JUnit tests would catch logic errors, and Spring Boot Test would validate integrations. If tests fail, the pipeline stops, as I configured at NielsenIQ to prevent bad deployments.

---

### Docker and Kubernetes

#### Docker Basics
19. **How do you containerize a Spring Boot application using Docker?**
    - **Answer:** I create a `Dockerfile` that starts with a Java base image, copies the Spring Boot JAR, sets the entry point, and exposes the port. Then, I build and run it with `docker build` and `docker run`. This mirrors my NielsenIQ approach.

   - **Code Snippet (Dockerfile):**
     ```dockerfile
     FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim
     COPY target/spring-app-1.0.0.jar app.jar
     EXPOSE 8080
     ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
     ```

20. **What’s in your Dockerfile for a typical Spring Boot app?**
    - **Answer:** It includes a base image (`openjdk:17`), the JAR copy step, port exposure (e.g., 8080), and an `ENTRYPOINT` to run the JAR. I’d add health check commands if needed, similar to my NielsenIQ Docker setups.

21. **How do you optimize a Docker image for a Spring Boot application (e.g., multi-stage builds)?**
    - **Answer:** I use a multi-stage build: one stage builds the JAR with Maven, and the next copies it to a slim runtime image. This reduces image size and removes build tools, improving security and speed.

   - **Code Snippet (Multi-stage Dockerfile):**
     ```dockerfile
     FROM maven:3.8-openjdk-17 AS build
     WORKDIR /app
     COPY . .
     RUN mvn clean package
     FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim
     COPY --from=build /app/target/spring-app-1.0.0.jar app.jar
     EXPOSE 8080
     ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
     ```

22. **How did you use Docker in your Doctor-Patient Interaction System project, and how would you adapt it for Spring Boot?**
    - **Answer:** In my project, I used Docker to containerize PHP, MySQL, and the app, managed via Docker Compose. For Spring Boot, I’d replace PHP with a Spring Boot JAR, keep MySQL, and update the `Dockerfile` to use Java, ensuring REST APIs handle the same logic.

23. **What are the benefits of Docker containerization for Spring Boot deployments?**
    - **Answer:** Docker ensures consistency across dev, test, and prod, encapsulates dependencies (e.g., Java runtime), and simplifies scaling with Kubernetes. At NielsenIQ, it eliminated environment mismatches, streamlining deployments.

#### Kubernetes Integration
24. **How do you deploy a Spring Boot app to Kubernetes?**
    - **Answer:** I create a Deployment YAML with replicas, a Pod spec for the Docker image, and a Service to expose it. I apply it with `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml`. At NielsenIQ, I used this for scalable deployments.

   - **Code Snippet (Deployment YAML):**
     ```yaml
     apiVersion: apps/v1
     kind: Deployment
     metadata:
       name: spring-app
     spec:
       replicas: 3
       selector:
         matchLabels:
           app: spring-app
       template:
         metadata:
           labels:
             app: spring-app
         spec:
           containers:
           - name: spring-app
             image: spring-app:latest
             ports:
             - containerPort: 8080
     ---
     apiVersion: v1
     kind: Service
     metadata:
       name: spring-app-service
     spec:
       selector:
         app: spring-app
       ports:
       - port: 80
         targetPort: 8080
       type: LoadBalancer
     ```

25. **What Kubernetes resources do you use for a Spring Boot microservice?**
    - **Answer:** I use a Deployment for managing Pods, a Service for internal networking, a ConfigMap for app configs, a Secret for sensitive data, and an Ingress for external access. This setup scales and secures the app, as I did at NielsenIQ.

26. **How do you configure a Spring Boot app to scale horizontally in Kubernetes?**
    - **Answer:** I set replicas in the Deployment and configure a HorizontalPodAutoscaler (HPA) based on CPU/memory metrics from Spring Boot Actuator. At NielsenIQ, this dynamically adjusted to load, improving efficiency.

27. **What’s the role of Kubernetes in your NielsenIQ experience, and how did it improve deployment efficiency?**
    - **Answer:** At NielsenIQ, Kubernetes orchestrated Docker containers, enabling auto-scaling, rolling updates, and self-healing. It cut deployment overhead by automating resource management, boosting efficiency for our apps.

28. **How do you manage secrets and configurations for a Spring Boot app in Kubernetes?**
    - **Answer:** I use Kubernetes Secrets for sensitive data like DB passwords and ConfigMaps for profiles (`application.yml`). Spring Boot accesses them via environment variables or mounted volumes, ensuring secure and flexible config management.

#### Practical Experience
29. **You spearheaded Docker containerization at NielsenIQ. Can you explain how you eliminated deployment errors with it?**
    - **Answer:** I containerized apps with Docker, ensuring consistent environments from dev to prod. By testing images locally and using health checks, I caught issues early, reducing errors to zero during rollouts—a strategy I’d apply to Spring Boot.

30. **How do you ensure a Spring Boot app inside a Docker container communicates with an external database (e.g., RDS)?**
    - **Answer:** I configure the Spring Boot `application.yml` with RDS endpoint, username, and password (from Secrets), and ensure the container’s network allows DB access. At NielsenIQ, I used VPC configs for secure connectivity.

31. **What challenges have you faced with Kubernetes orchestration for containerized apps, and how did you overcome them?**
    - **Answer:** At NielsenIQ, Pods crashed due to resource limits. I debugged with `kubectl logs`, adjusted CPU/memory in the Deployment, and added liveness probes, stabilizing the cluster—applicable to Spring Boot too.

32. **How do you handle health checks for a Spring Boot app in Kubernetes (e.g., Spring Boot Actuator)?**
    - **Answer:** I enable Actuator’s `/actuator/health` endpoint in Spring Boot and configure Kubernetes liveness and readiness probes to check it. This ensures Pods restart or delay traffic if unhealthy, as I did with custom metrics at NielsenIQ.

#### Scenario-Based
33. **If a Spring Boot app in Kubernetes keeps crashing due to memory issues, how would you diagnose and fix it?**
    - **Answer:** I’d check `kubectl describe pod` for OOM errors, review Actuator metrics for memory usage, increase resource limits in the Deployment, and optimize the app (e.g., reduce heap size). I’d test the fix locally first.

34. **How would you set up a blue-green deployment for a Spring Boot app using Docker and Kubernetes?**
    - **Answer:** I’d deploy the new version as a separate Deployment (green), test it with a temporary Service, then switch the main Service’s selector to green once validated, deleting the old (blue). This ensures zero downtime, as I practiced at NielsenIQ.

35. **Suppose a Spring Boot microservice in Kubernetes is slow to respond. What steps would you take to optimize it?**
    - **Answer:** I’d check Actuator metrics for latency, profile the app for bottlenecks, scale Pods with HPA, and optimize DB queries or caching. At NielsenIQ, similar steps improved performance by 30%.

### AWS Integration

#### AWS Basics
36. **How do you deploy a Spring Boot application to AWS EC2?**
    - **Answer:** I’d build the Spring Boot JAR, create a Docker image, launch an EC2 instance, install Docker, pull the image, and run it. Alternatively, I’d SCP the JAR and run it with Java, configuring security groups for port access.

37. **What AWS services have you used with Spring Boot or similar apps?**
    - **Answer:** At NielsenIQ, I used EC2 for hosting, EKS for Kubernetes, RDS for databases, S3 for storage, and CloudWatch for monitoring—all applicable to Spring Boot for scalable, monitored deployments.

38. **How do you configure a Spring Boot app to connect to an AWS RDS database?**
    - **Answer:** I’d set the RDS endpoint, username, and password in `application.yml`, use Spring Data JPA, and ensure the app’s security group allows RDS access. I’d encrypt credentials with Secrets Manager.

   - **Code Snippet (application.yml):**
     ```yaml
     spring:
       datasource:
         url: jdbc:mysql://rds-endpoint:3306/dbname
         username: ${RDS_USERNAME}
         password: ${RDS_PASSWORD}
     ```

39. **What’s the role of Terraform in deploying a Spring Boot app to AWS, based on your experience?**
    - **Answer:** Terraform provisions infrastructure like EC2, RDS, or EKS clusters. At NielsenIQ, I used it to automate setups, reducing provisioning time by 20%. For Spring Boot, I’d define these resources in `.tf` files and deploy the app atop them.

40. **How does Ansible complement Terraform in managing AWS infrastructure for Spring Boot?**
    - **Answer:** Terraform creates the infrastructure, while Ansible configures it—e.g., installing Java, Docker, or app-specific settings on EC2. At NielsenIQ, this duo streamlined ops, which I’d use for Spring Boot consistency.

#### Deployment and Optimization
41. **How would you use AWS EKS to deploy a containerized Spring Boot application?**
    - **Answer:** I’d create an EKS cluster with Terraform, build a Spring Boot Docker image, push it to ECR, and deploy it with Kubernetes YAMLs via `kubectl`. I’d use EKS auto-scaling for load handling, as at NielsenIQ.

42. **You reduced provisioning time by 20% with Terraform. How would you apply this to a Spring Boot deployment on AWS?**

47. **How do you integrate Spring Boot with AWS CloudWatch for monitoring (from your resume)?**
    - **Answer:** I’d enable Actuator, expose metrics, and use the Spring Boot CloudWatch integration to send them to CloudWatch. At NielsenIQ, I wrote Python scripts for custom metrics, which I’d adapt to Java for Spring Boot.

48. **Have you used AWS Lambda with Spring Boot? If not, how might you approach it?**
    - **Answer:** I haven’t, but I’d use Spring Cloud Function to write Lambda-compatible handlers, package them with Maven, and deploy via AWS SAM. It’s a lightweight alternative to EC2 for event-driven tasks.

49. **How did you reduce operational costs by 25% in your cloud optimizations at NielsenIQ?**
    - **Answer:** I rightsized EC2 instances, implemented auto-scaling, and used reserved instances. For Spring Boot, I’d apply the same, plus optimize Docker images to reduce resource usage.

#### Scenario-Based
50. **If a Spring Boot app on EC2 is experiencing downtime, how would you troubleshoot it?**
    - **Answer:** I’d check EC2 logs, CloudWatch metrics for CPU/memory spikes, and Actuator health. If the app crashed, I’d restart it, review configs, and scale up if needed, ensuring uptime.

51. **How would you migrate a monolithic Spring Boot app from on-premises to AWS EKS?**
    - **Answer:** I’d containerize it with Docker, test locally, provision an EKS cluster with Terraform, push the image to ECR, and deploy with Kubernetes YAMLs. I’d migrate the DB to RDS, updating connection strings.

52. **Suppose an AWS RDS database connection fails in production. How do you debug and resolve it?**
    - **Answer:** I’d check CloudWatch logs for errors, verify RDS status, test connectivity from the app’s subnet, and ensure credentials match. I’d fix config issues in `application.yml` and redeploy if needed.

54. **What is Spring Boot Actuator, and how do you use it with AWS CloudWatch?**
    - **Answer:** Actuator provides endpoints like `/actuator/health` and `/actuator/metrics`. I’d enable it, add the CloudWatch dependency, and configure it to push metrics, as I did with custom monitoring at NielsenIQ.

   - **Code Snippet (application.yml):**
     ```yaml
     management:
       endpoints:
         web:
           exposure:
             include: health,metrics
       metrics:
         export:
           cloudwatch:
             enabled: true
             namespace: spring-app
     ```

55. **How do you set up custom metrics and alarms for a Spring Boot app using CloudWatch?**
    - **Answer:** I’d use Micrometer to define custom metrics in Spring Boot, push them to CloudWatch, and create alarms (e.g., CPU > 80%) via the AWS console or Terraform, mirroring my NielsenIQ setup.

56. **What key metrics do you monitor for a Spring Boot app?**
    - **Answer:** I track CPU/memory usage, request latency, error rates, DB connection pools, and JVM metrics (heap, threads) via Actuator. These ensure performance and reliability, as I monitored at NielsenIQ.

#### Practical Experience
57. **You implemented CloudWatch monitoring with custom metrics at NielsenIQ. How would you apply this to Spring Boot?**
    - **Answer:** I’d enable Actuator, define custom metrics (e.g., request count), and send them to CloudWatch. At NielsenIQ, I used Python for metrics; for Spring Boot, I’d use Java and Micrometer.

   - **Code Snippet (Custom Metric):**
     ```java
     @Autowired
     private MeterRegistry meterRegistry;
     public void recordRequest() {
         meterRegistry.counter("http.requests.total").increment();
     }
     ```

58. **How do you ensure system reliability and uptime for a Spring Boot app using monitoring tools?**
    - **Answer:** I set up health checks with Actuator, monitor key metrics in CloudWatch, and configure alerts for anomalies. At NielsenIQ, this proactive approach kept systems stable, which I’d replicate.
