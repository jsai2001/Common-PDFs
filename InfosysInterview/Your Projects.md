### Containerized Doctor-Patient System

#### 1. Can you walk us through the architecture of your Doctor-Patient Interaction and Appointment System?
**Answer:**  
The Doctor-Patient Interaction and Appointment System is an online portal I built to streamline communication and scheduling between doctors and patients. The architecture consists of three main layers:  
- **Front-End:** Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to provide a user-friendly interface for patients to request appointments and doctors to manage schedules and generate receipts.  
- **Back-End:** Powered by PHP, handling the business logic such as appointment creation, schedule updates, and receipt generation. It processes user inputs from the front-end and interacts with the database.  
- **Database:** MySQL stores all persistent data—patient details, doctor schedules, and appointment records—ensuring reliable data management.  

To ensure scalability and deployment consistency, I containerized the application using Docker. I used Docker Compose to orchestrate three containers: one for the PHP back-end with an Apache server, one for the MySQL database, and a lightweight container for static front-end assets. This setup allowed me to isolate dependencies and deploy the app seamlessly across environments.

---

#### 2. Why did you choose Docker for this system?
**Answer:**  
I chose Docker for several reasons:  
- **Portability:** Docker ensures the app runs consistently across development, testing, and production environments by packaging dependencies (e.g., PHP, MySQL) into containers.  
- **Scalability:** Containers make it easy to scale individual components (e.g., adding more back-end instances) if demand increases.  
- **Simplified Deployment:** With Docker Compose, I could define and spin up the entire stack with a single command (`docker-compose up`), reducing setup time and errors.  
- **Isolation:** Each service (front-end, back-end, database) runs in its own container, preventing conflicts between dependencies.  

This aligns with modern DevOps practices, which I’ve applied extensively at NielsenIQ, and it made the project easier to maintain and share.

---

#### 3. How would you refactor this system using Java and Spring Boot instead of PHP?
**Answer:**  
To refactor this system with Java and Spring Boot, I’d redesign it as a RESTful application with a clear separation of concerns:  
- **Back-End:** Replace PHP with Spring Boot to build a REST API. I’d use `@RestController` to define endpoints like `/appointments` for booking and `/doctors/{id}/schedule` for managing schedules. Spring Boot’s dependency injection and auto-configuration would simplify setup.  
- **Database Access:** Use Spring Data JPA with Hibernate to map MySQL tables (e.g., `Patient`, `Doctor`, `Appointment`) to Java entities, replacing raw PHP MySQL queries.  
- **Front-End:** Keep HTML/CSS/JS but enhance it with a framework like React, consuming the Spring Boot REST API.  
- **Containerization:** Package the Spring Boot app as a JAR, build a Docker image, and update Docker Compose to include it alongside MySQL.  

**Code Snippet (Spring Boot REST Controller):**  
```java
@RestController
@RequestMapping("/api")
public class AppointmentController {
    @Autowired
    private AppointmentService appointmentService;

    @PostMapping("/appointments")
    public ResponseEntity<Appointment> bookAppointment(@RequestBody AppointmentRequest request) {
        Appointment appointment = appointmentService.bookAppointment(request);
        return ResponseEntity.ok(appointment);
    }

    @GetMapping("/doctors/{id}/schedule")
    public ResponseEntity<List<Schedule>> getDoctorSchedule(@PathVariable Long id) {
        List<Schedule> schedule = appointmentService.getSchedule(id);
        return ResponseEntity.ok(schedule);
    }
}
```

**Benefits:** Spring Boot offers type safety, better testing support (e.g., JUnit), and a robust ecosystem compared to PHP, making it ideal for a senior developer role.

#### 4. How would you integrate MySQL with Spring Boot in the refactored version?
**Answer:**  
I’d use Spring Data JPA to integrate MySQL with Spring Boot:  
- **Entity Classes:** Define Java classes like `Appointment` with annotations like `@Entity` and `@Id` to map to MySQL tables.  
- **Repository Layer:** Create an interface extending `JpaRepository` for CRUD operations.  
- **Configuration:** Add MySQL connection details in `application.properties`.  

**Code Snippet (Entity and Repository):**  
```java
@Entity
@Table(name = "appointments")
public class Appointment {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    private Long patientId;
    private Long doctorId;
    private LocalDateTime appointmentTime;
    // Getters and setters
}

@Repository
public interface AppointmentRepository extends JpaRepository<Appointment, Long> {
    List<Appointment> findByDoctorId(Long doctorId);
}
```

**Configuration (application.properties):**  
```properties
spring.datasource.url=jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/doctor_patient_db
spring.datasource.username=root
spring.datasource.password=password
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=update
```
This setup leverages Spring Boot’s ORM capabilities, replacing PHP’s manual query handling with a more structured approach.

---

#### 5. How would you deploy the refactored Spring Boot app in a containerized environment?
**Answer:**  
I’d deploy the refactored Spring Boot app as follows:  
1. **Build the JAR:** Use Maven to package the app (`mvn clean package`).  
2. **Dockerize:** Create a `Dockerfile` to build an image with the JAR.  
3. **Orchestrate:** Update `docker-compose.yml` to include the Spring Boot service and MySQL.  
4. **Run:** Deploy locally with `docker-compose up` or scale it on Kubernetes for production.  

**Code Snippet (Dockerfile):**  
```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:17-jdk-slim
WORKDIR /app
COPY target/doctor-patient-system-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar app.jar
EXPOSE 8080
ENTRYPOINT ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

**Code Snippet (docker-compose.yml):**  
```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  app:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    depends_on:
      - db
  db:
    image: mysql:8.0
    environment:
      MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: password
      MYSQL_DATABASE: doctor_patient_db
    ports:
      - "3306:3306"
```
This mirrors my NielsenIQ experience with Docker and Kubernetes, ensuring consistent deployments.

### NielsenIQ CI/CD and Data Systems

#### 6. Can you describe the CI/CD pipelines you built at NielsenIQ and the tools involved?
**Answer:**  
At NielsenIQ, I designed and managed CI/CD pipelines to automate application deployments:  
- **Tools:** Jenkins for pipeline orchestration, GitHub Actions for additional workflows, Maven for building Java-based apps, Docker for containerization, and Kubernetes for orchestration. I also used Python and Shell scripting for custom automation.  
- **Pipeline Flow:**  
  1. Code push to GitHub triggers Jenkins.  
  2. Maven builds the app and runs tests.  
  3. Docker creates a container image, tagged with the build number.  
  4. Kubernetes deploys the image to AWS EKS, with rollback capabilities.  
- **Impact:** Reduced deployment time by 25% by optimizing build stages and caching dependencies.  

This experience directly applies to Spring Boot, where I’d use similar tools to streamline deployments.

---

#### 7. How did you achieve a 25% reduction in deployment time with your CI/CD pipelines?
**Answer:**  
I achieved a 25% reduction in deployment time through:  
- **Parallel Builds:** Configured Jenkins to run test and build stages concurrently using Groovy scripts.  
- **Dependency Caching:** Cached Maven dependencies in Jenkins to avoid redundant downloads.  
- **Optimized Docker Images:** Used multi-stage Docker builds to reduce image size and build time.  
- **Prebuilt Base Images:** Standardized base images with pre-installed dependencies.  

**Code Snippet (Jenkins Pipeline Example):**  
```groovy
pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            parallel {
                stage('Compile') { steps { sh 'mvn compile' } }
                stage('Test') { steps { sh 'mvn test' } }
            }
        }
        stage('Dockerize') { steps { sh 'docker build -t app:${BUILD_NUMBER} .' } }
        stage('Deploy') { steps { sh 'kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml' } }
    }
}
```
These optimizations would seamlessly apply to a Spring Boot CI/CD pipeline.

---

#### 8. How would you adapt your CI/CD experience to deploy a Spring Boot application?
**Answer:**  
For a Spring Boot app, I’d adapt my NielsenIQ CI/CD approach:  
1. **Build:** Use Maven to compile and package the Spring Boot app into a JAR.  
2. **Test:** Run JUnit and integration tests in Jenkins.  
3. **Dockerize:** Build a Docker image with the JAR (as shown earlier).  
4. **Deploy:** Use Kubernetes to deploy to AWS EKS, leveraging Helm charts for configuration.  
5. **Monitor:** Integrate Spring Boot Actuator endpoints (`/actuator/health`) with AWS CloudWatch for real-time monitoring.  

This mirrors my NielsenIQ workflow, ensuring reliability and efficiency.

---

#### 9. You mentioned Python automation scripts for container management—can you give an example?
**Answer:**  
At NielsenIQ, I wrote a Python script to automate container scaling based on resource usage:  
- **Purpose:** Monitor Docker container CPU/memory usage and scale Kubernetes pods if thresholds were exceeded.  
- **Implementation:** Used the `docker` Python library to fetch stats and `kubectl` commands via `subprocess` to adjust pod replicas.  
- **Impact:** Improved performance by 30% by dynamically optimizing resource allocation.  

**Code Snippet (Python Example):**  
```python
import docker
import subprocess

client = docker.from_client()
threshold = 80  # CPU usage percentage
for container in client.containers.list():
    stats = container.stats(stream=False)
    cpu_usage = stats['cpu_stats']['cpu_usage']['total_usage']
    if cpu_usage > threshold:
        subprocess.run(["kubectl", "scale", "deployment/app", "--replicas=3"])
```
This automation ensured system reliability under load.

---

#### 10. How would you rewrite those Python scripts in Java for a Spring Boot environment?
**Answer:**  
In a Spring Boot app, I’d rewrite the script as a scheduled task:  
- **Approach:** Use Spring’s `@Scheduled` annotation to periodically check resource usage via Kubernetes APIs (e.g., `io.kubernetes.client` library) and scale deployments.  
- **Benefit:** Integrates directly into the app, leveraging Java’s type safety and Spring’s ecosystem.  

**Code Snippet (Spring Boot Java):**  
```java
@Service
public class ContainerManager {
    @Autowired
    private KubernetesClient kubernetesClient;

    @Scheduled(fixedRate = 60000) // Run every minute
    public void manageContainers() {
        // Simplified example; real usage would query pod metrics
        int cpuUsage = fetchCpuUsage();
        if (cpuUsage > 80) {
            kubernetesClient.apps().deployments()
                .inNamespace("default")
                .withName("app")
                .scale(3);
        }
    }

    private int fetchCpuUsage() { /* Call Kubernetes API */ return 85; }
}
```

**Dependencies (pom.xml):**  
```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.kubernetes</groupId>
    <artifactId>client-java</artifactId>
    <version>18.0.0</version>
</dependency>
```
This refactors the Python logic into a Spring Boot service, aligning with the role.
