### Spring Core

#### Dependency Injection (DI)

1. **What is Dependency Injection, and how does Spring implement it?**
   - **Answer:** Dependency Injection is a design pattern where dependencies are provided to a class rather than the class creating them itself, promoting loose coupling. Spring implements DI through its IoC container, which manages beans and injects them using annotations like `@Autowired` or XML configuration. For example, in my NielsenIQ work, I used dependency injection-like principles in Python automation, which I could replicate in Spring to inject services into controllers.
   - **Code Snippet:**
     ```java
     @Service
     public class UserService {
         public String getUser() { return "User"; }
     }

     @RestController
     public class UserController {
         private final UserService userService;

         @Autowired
         public UserController(UserService userService) {
             this.userService = userService;
         }
     }
     ```

2. **Explain the difference between constructor injection, setter injection, and field injection. Which do you prefer and why?**
   - **Answer:** Constructor injection passes dependencies via a constructor, ensuring immutability and mandatory dependencies (my preference). Setter injection uses setters, allowing optional dependencies but risking mutability. Field injection uses `@Autowired` directly on fields, which is simpler but less testable and hides dependencies. I prefer constructor injection for its clarity and testability, aligning with my focus on reliable systems at NielsenIQ.
   - **Code Snippet (Constructor Injection):**
     ```java
     @RestController
     public class UserController {
         private final UserService userService;

         public UserController(UserService userService) {
             this.userService = userService;
         }
     }
     ```

3. **How would you handle circular dependencies in Spring?**
   - **Answer:** Circular dependencies occur when two beans depend on each other (e.g., A needs B, B needs A). Spring resolves this at runtime with proxies, but I’d avoid it by redesigning the architecture—e.g., using an intermediary service or event-driven approach. If unavoidable, `@Lazy` on one dependency delays its initialization, breaking the cycle.

4. **What are the advantages of using DI over manual instantiation of objects?**
   - **Answer:** DI reduces coupling, improves testability (e.g., mocking dependencies), and centralizes configuration. In my CI/CD work, I automated dependency management with Maven, and DI in Spring offers similar benefits by letting the container handle object creation.

5. **Can you explain `@Autowired` and its role in DI? What happens if multiple beans of the same type exist?**
   - **Answer:** `@Autowired` tells Spring to inject a bean automatically. If multiple beans of the same type exist, Spring throws a `NoUniqueBeanDefinitionException`. I’d resolve this with `@Qualifier` to specify the bean name or use `@Primary` to prioritize one.
   - **Code Snippet:**
     ```java
     @Autowired
     @Qualifier("specificService")
     private UserService userService;
     ```

#### Inversion of Control (IoC)

6. **What is Inversion of Control, and how does it differ from traditional control flow?**
   - **Answer:** IoC inverts control by having a framework (Spring) manage object creation and lifecycle, unlike traditional flow where the application controls it. This decouples components, similar to how I let Jenkins manage pipelines at NielsenIQ instead of manual scripting.

7. **How does the Spring IoC container work under the hood?**
   - **Answer:** The IoC container (e.g., `ApplicationContext`) reads configuration (annotations/XML), creates beans, resolves dependencies, and manages their lifecycle. It uses reflection to instantiate and wire objects, which I’ve indirectly leveraged in automation tools.

8. **What are the differences between `BeanFactory` and `ApplicationContext`?**
   - **Answer:** `BeanFactory` is a basic IoC container with lazy loading, while `ApplicationContext` extends it with eager loading, event propagation, and additional features like internationalization. I’d use `ApplicationContext` in Spring Boot for its robustness.

9. **How would you create a custom bean in Spring using IoC?**
   - **Answer:** I’d define it with `@Bean` in a `@Configuration` class or use `@Component` for auto-detection.
   - **Code Snippet:**
     ```java
     @Configuration
     public class AppConfig {
         @Bean
         public UserService userService() {
             return new UserService();
         }
     }
     ```

10. **What is the significance of the `@Component` annotation in IoC?**
    - **Answer:** `@Component` marks a class as a Spring-managed bean, auto-detected during component scanning. It’s the base for `@Service`, `@Repository`, etc., simplifying bean definition.

#### Bean Lifecycle

11. **Describe the lifecycle of a Spring Bean from creation to destruction.**
    - **Answer:** Spring creates a bean by: 1) Instantiation, 2) Populating properties (DI), 3) Calling `@PostConstruct` for initialization, 4) Using the bean, 5) Calling `@PreDestroy` before destruction. I’d use this in my Doctor-Patient app to initialize database connections.

12. **How can you customize the initialization and destruction phases of a bean?**
    - **Answer:** Use `@PostConstruct` for initialization and `@PreDestroy` for cleanup.
    - **Code Snippet:**
      ```java
      @Component
      public class DatabaseService {
          @PostConstruct
          public void init() { System.out.println("Initializing DB"); }

          @PreDestroy
          public void cleanup() { System.out.println("Closing DB"); }
      }
      ```

13. **What is the difference between singleton and prototype bean scopes? Provide a use case for each.**
    - **Answer:** Singleton scope (default) creates one instance per container—great for stateless services like my NielsenIQ automation scripts. Prototype scope creates a new instance per request—useful for stateful objects like user sessions in my Doctor-Patient app.

14. **How do you handle bean post-processing in Spring?**
    - **Answer:** Implement `BeanPostProcessor` to modify beans before/after initialization—e.g., adding logging or validation.

15. **What happens if a bean fails to initialize? How would you debug it?**
    - **Answer:** Spring throws an exception (e.g., `BeanCreationException`). I’d check logs for stack traces, verify dependencies, and use Spring Boot’s debug mode (`--debug`)—similar to debugging pipeline failures at NielsenIQ.

### Spring Boot Basics

#### Auto-Configuration

16. **What is Spring Boot auto-configuration, and how does it simplify development?**
    - **Answer:** Auto-configuration automatically configures beans based on classpath dependencies (e.g., adding Tomcat for `spring-boot-starter-web`). It reduces manual setup, letting me focus on logic—like how I automated infrastructure at NielsenIQ.

17. **How does Spring Boot decide which beans to auto-configure?**
    - **Answer:** It scans the classpath and uses `@Conditional` annotations (e.g., `@ConditionalOnClass`) to match dependencies and properties.

18. **Can you disable auto-configuration for a specific feature? How?**
    - **Answer:** Yes, with `@SpringBootApplication(exclude = {SpecificAutoConfiguration.class})`—e.g., excluding `DataSourceAutoConfiguration` if I manage the database manually.

19. **What is the role of the `@SpringBootApplication` annotation?**
    - **Answer:** It’s a composite of `@Configuration`, `@EnableAutoConfiguration`, and `@ComponentScan`, bootstrapping the app.

20. **How would you troubleshoot an issue caused by an incorrect auto-configuration?**
    - **Answer:** Enable `spring-boot-autoconfigure` logging, review the `ConditionEvaluationReport` (via Actuator), and adjust dependencies or properties.

#### Starters

21. **What are Spring Boot Starters, and why are they useful?**
    - **Answer:** Starters are dependency aggregates (e.g., `spring-boot-starter-web`) that simplify setup by including related libraries and configurations—similar to how I used Maven at NielsenIQ for dependency management.

22. **Name a few commonly used Spring Boot Starters and their purposes.**
    - **Answer:** `spring-boot-starter-web` (REST/MVC), `spring-boot-starter-data-jpa` (JPA/Hibernate), `spring-boot-starter-security` (authentication)—I’d use these for my Doctor-Patient app.

23. **How would you create a custom Spring Boot Starter?**
    - **Answer:** Create a library with dependencies, an auto-configuration class, and a `spring.factories` file—e.g., for a custom logging setup.

24. **What happens if two starters conflict in dependency versions?**
    - **Answer:** Maven/Gradle resolves to the nearest version. I’d override it in `pom.xml`—a trick I used at NielsenIQ for build consistency.

25. **How do starters interact with the dependency management system?**
    - **Answer:** They leverage Spring Boot’s BOM (Bill of Materials) in `spring-boot-dependencies` to ensure compatible versions.

#### Simplification of Development

26. **How does Spring Boot reduce boilerplate code compared to traditional Spring?**
    - **Answer:** Auto-configuration, starters, and sensible defaults eliminate XML and manual bean wiring—unlike traditional Spring’s verbosity.

27. **What is the embedded server in Spring Boot? How do you switch between them?**
    - **Answer:** It’s a built-in server (default: Tomcat). Switch by excluding `spring-boot-starter-tomcat` and adding `spring-boot-starter-jetty`.

28. **How does Spring Boot handle application bootstrapping differently from Spring MVC?**
    - **Answer:** Spring Boot uses `@SpringBootApplication` and an embedded server, while Spring MVC requires external server setup and more manual config.

29. **What are the benefits of using Spring Boot over a traditional Java EE application?**
    - **Answer:** Faster setup, embedded servers, microservices support, and less configuration—aligning with my cloud-native focus at NielsenIQ.

30. **How would you migrate a legacy Spring application to Spring Boot?**
    - **Answer:** Replace XML with annotations, add starters, use `SpringApplication.run()`, and refactor deprecated configs—similar to modernizing my PHP project.

### RESTful APIs

#### Design and Implementation

31. **How do you design a RESTful API using Spring Boot? What principles do you follow?**
    - **Answer:** I follow REST constraints: statelessness, resource-based URIs, and HTTP methods. For my Doctor-Patient app, I’d design `/appointments` for CRUD operations.

32. **Explain the purpose of `@RestController` vs. `@Controller`.**
    - **Answer:** `@RestController` combines `@Controller` and `@ResponseBody`, returning JSON directly, while `@Controller` is for MVC views.

33. **How do you implement GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE endpoints?**
    - **Code Snippet:**
      ```java
      @RestController
      @RequestMapping("/appointments")
      public class AppointmentController {
          @GetMapping("/{id}")
          public Appointment get(@PathVariable Long id) { return service.findById(id); }

          @PostMapping
          public Appointment create(@RequestBody Appointment appointment) { return service.save(appointment); }

          @PutMapping("/{id}")
          public Appointment update(@PathVariable Long id, @RequestBody Appointment appointment) { return service.update(id, appointment); }

          @DeleteMapping("/{id}")
          public void delete(@PathVariable Long id) { service.delete(id); }
      }
      ```

34. **What is the role of `@RequestBody` and `@ResponseBody`?**
    - **Answer:** `@RequestBody` deserializes JSON to objects; `@ResponseBody` serializes objects to JSON—key for REST APIs.

35. **How do you handle path variables and query parameters?**
    - **Code Snippet:**
      ```java
      @GetMapping("/appointments")
      public List<Appointment> getAppointments(@RequestParam String date, @PathVariable Long doctorId) {
          return service.findByDateAndDoctor(date, doctorId);
      }
      ```

      public class UserController {
          private final UserService userService;

          @Autowired
          public UserController(UserService userService) { this.userService = userService; }

          @GetMapping("/{id}")
          public ResponseEntity<User> getUser(@PathVariable Long id) {
              return ResponseEntity.ok(userService.findById(id));
          }
      }
      ```

      @ControllerAdvice
      public class GlobalExceptionHandler {
          @ExceptionHandler(ResourceNotFoundException.class)
          public ResponseEntity<String> handleNotFound(ResourceNotFoundException ex) {
              return ResponseEntity.status(HttpStatus.NOT_FOUND).body(ex.getMessage());
          }
      }
      ```

38. **What is the significance of HTTP status codes in REST APIs? Give examples.**
    - **Answer:** They indicate success/failure: 200 (OK), 201 (Created), 404 (Not Found), 400 (Bad Request)—e.g., 201 for creating an appointment.

39. **How do you secure a REST API in Spring Boot?**
    - **Answer:** Use Spring Security with JWT or OAuth2—e.g., securing my Doctor-Patient APIs with role-based access.

40. **How would you implement pagination and sorting in a REST API?**
    - **Code Snippet:**
      ```java
      @GetMapping("/appointments")
      public Page<Appointment> getAppointments(Pageable pageable) {
          return appointmentService.findAll(pageable);
      }
      ```

#### Advanced REST

41. **What is HATEOAS, and how can you implement it in Spring Boot?**
    - **Answer:** HATEOAS adds hypermedia links to responses. Use `spring-boot-starter-hateoas`.
    - **Code Snippet:**
      ```java
      @GetMapping("/users/{id}")
      public EntityModel<User> getUser(@PathVariable Long id) {
          User user = userService.findById(id);
          return EntityModel.of(user, linkTo(methodOn(UserController.class).getUser(id)).withSelfRel());
      }
      ```

42. **How do you handle versioning of REST APIs?**
    - **Answer:** Use URI versioning (e.g., `/v1/users`) or header versioning (e.g., `Accept: application/vnd.v1+json`).

43. **How would you optimize a slow-performing REST endpoint?**
    - **Answer:** Add caching (Spring Cache), optimize DB queries, or use async processing—similar to my 30% performance boost at NielsenIQ.

44. **What are the differences between synchronous and asynchronous REST endpoints?**
    - **Answer:** Sync blocks until complete; async returns immediately. Use `@Async` for async.
    - **Code Snippet:**
      ```java
      @Async
      @PostMapping("/process")
      public CompletableFuture<String> process() {
          return CompletableFuture.completedFuture("Done");
      }
      ```

45. **How do you validate incoming request data?**
    - **Code Snippet:**
      ```java
      @PostMapping("/users")
      public ResponseEntity<User> createUser(@Valid @RequestBody UserDTO userDTO) {
          return ResponseEntity.ok(userService.save(userDTO));
      }
      ```

### Data Access

#### Spring Data JPA

46. **What is Spring Data JPA, and how does it simplify database interactions?**
    - **Answer:** It provides repository interfaces to abstract CRUD operations, reducing boilerplate—e.g., I’d use it for my MySQL-based Doctor-Patient app.

47. **How do you define an entity in Spring Data JPA?**
    - **Code Snippet:**
      ```java
      @Entity
      public class Appointment {
          @Id
          @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
          private Long id;
          @Column(nullable = false)
          private String date;
      }
      ```

48. **What is the purpose of a `Repository` interface?**
    - **Code Snippet:**
      ```java
      @Repository
      public interface AppointmentRepository extends JpaRepository<Appointment, Long> {
          List<Appointment> findByDate(String date);
      }
      ```

49. **How does Spring Data JPA integrate with Hibernate?**
    - **Answer:** It uses Hibernate as the default JPA provider for ORM, mapping entities to tables.

50. **How would you handle lazy loading vs. eager loading in JPA relationships?**
    - **Answer:** Use `fetch = FetchType.LAZY` for performance, `EAGER` for immediate needs—e.g., lazy-load patients in appointments.

#### Hibernate

51. **What is Hibernate, and how does it relate to Spring Boot?**
    - **Answer:** Hibernate is an ORM framework integrated via Spring Data JPA for database mapping.

52. **Explain the difference between `@OneToOne`, `@OneToMany`, and `@ManyToMany`.**
    - **Answer:** `@OneToOne` (doctor-profile), `@OneToMany` (doctor-appointments), `@ManyToMany` (doctors-patients with join table).

53. **How do you optimize Hibernate performance?**
    - **Answer:** Use second-level caching, avoid N+1 queries with `JOIN FETCH`, and batch updates—similar to my Snowflake SQL optimizations.

54. **What is the purpose of the `SessionFactory` and `EntityManager`?**
    - **Answer:** `SessionFactory` creates sessions; `EntityManager` (JPA) manages entity lifecycle—used by Spring Data JPA.

55. **How would you debug a slow Hibernate query?**
    - **Answer:** Enable SQL logging (`spring.jpa.show-sql=true`), analyze execution plans, and optimize with indexes.

#### Database Interactions

56. **How do you connect a Spring Boot application to a MySQL database?**

### Spring MVC

#### MVC Pattern

61. **Explain the Model-View-Controller (MVC) pattern and how Spring Boot implements it.**
    - **Answer:** MVC separates data (Model), UI (View), and logic (Controller). Spring Boot uses `@Controller` and Thymeleaf for MVC.

62. **What is the role of the `Controller`, `Service`, and `Repository` layers?**
    - **Answer:** Controller handles requests, Service contains business logic, Repository manages data—mirroring my NielsenIQ layered automation.

63. **How does Spring Boot differ from traditional Spring MVC?**
    - **Answer:** Auto-configuration and embedded servers simplify setup.

64. **What is the purpose of the `DispatcherServlet`?**
    - **Answer:** It routes requests to controllers—core to Spring MVC.

65. **How do you handle form submissions in Spring MVC?**
    - **Code Snippet:**
      ```java
      @Controller
      public class FormController {
          @PostMapping("/submit")
          public String submitForm(@ModelAttribute Appointment appointment) {
              return "success";
          }
      }
      ```

#### Controllers and Services

66. **What’s the difference between `@Controller` and `@RestController`?**
    - **Answer:** `@Controller` returns views; `@RestController` returns data (JSON).

67. **How do you pass data from a controller to a view?**
    - **Code Snippet:**
      ```java
      @GetMapping("/view")
      public String showView(Model model) {
          model.addAttribute("appointment", new Appointment());
          return "appointmentView";
      }
      ```

68. **How would you structure a service layer?**
    - **Answer:** Separate business logic into `@Service` classes—e.g., appointment scheduling logic.

69. **How do you handle request validation?**
    - **Answer:** Use `@Valid` with Bean Validation annotations (e.g., `@NotNull`).

70. **What are the best practices for organizing controllers?**
    - **Answer:** Group by resource (e.g., `/users`, `/appointments`), keep thin, and delegate to services.

#### Spring Boot Enhancements

71. **How does Spring Boot enhance Spring MVC with auto-configuration?**
    - **Answer:** It sets up `DispatcherServlet`, view resolvers, and defaults automatically.

72. **What is the role of Thymeleaf?**
    - **Answer:** It’s a template engine for dynamic HTML views—e.g., displaying appointments.

73. **How would you implement a file upload feature?**
    - **Code Snippet:**
      ```java
      @PostMapping("/upload")
      public String uploadFile(@RequestParam("file") MultipartFile file) {
          fileService.store(file);
          return "success";
      }
      ```

74. **How do you integrate Spring MVC with RESTful services?**
    - **Answer:** Use `@Controller` for views and `@RestController` for APIs in the same app.

75. **How do you test a Spring MVC controller?**
    - **Code Snippet:**
      ```java
      @WebMvcTest(UserController.class)
      public class UserControllerTest {
          @Autowired
          private MockMvc mockMvc;

          @Test
          public void testGetUser() throws Exception {
              mockMvc.perform(get("/users/1")).andExpect(status().isOk());
          }
      }
      ```

### Configuration Management

#### Annotations

76. **What is the purpose of the `@Configuration` annotation?**
    - **Answer:** Marks a class as a source of bean definitions.
    - **Code Snippet:**
      ```java
      @Configuration
      public class AppConfig {
          @Bean
          public UserService userService() { return new UserService(); }
      }
      ```

77. **How do you define a bean using `@Bean`?**
    - **Answer:** In a `@Configuration` class—see above.

78. **How does `@EnableAutoConfiguration` work?**
    - **Answer:** It triggers Spring Boot’s auto-config based on dependencies.

79. **What is the role of `@Conditional` annotations?**
    - **Answer:** They create beans conditionally—e.g., `@ConditionalOnProperty`.

80. **How would you create a conditional bean?**
    - **Code Snippet:**
      ```java
      @Bean
      @ConditionalOnProperty(name = "feature.enabled", havingValue = "true")
      public FeatureService featureService() { return new FeatureService(); }
      ```

#### Properties and YAML

81. **How do you configure properties in `application.properties` or `application.yml`?**
    - **Answer:** Key-value pairs or YAML hierarchy—e.g., DB settings.

82. **What’s the difference between `@Value` and `@ConfigurationProperties`?**
    - **Answer:** `@Value` injects single values; `@ConfigurationProperties` binds to object structures.
    - **Code Snippet:**
      ```java
      @ConfigurationProperties(prefix = "app")
      public class AppConfig {
          private String name;
          // getters, setters
      }
      ```

83. **How do you manage environment-specific configurations?**
    - **Answer:** Use profiles—e.g., `application-dev.properties`.

84. **How would you externalize configuration?**
    - **Answer:** Use Spring Cloud Config with a Git repo.

85. **How do you override a default property value?**
    - **Answer:** Set it in `application.properties` or via command-line args.

#### Practical Configuration

86. **How do you configure a custom port?**
    - **Answer:** `server.port=8081` in `application.properties`.

87. **How would you set up logging levels?**
    - **Answer:** `logging.level.com.example=DEBUG` in `application.properties`.

88. **What is the Spring Boot Actuator?**
    - **Answer:** It provides endpoints (e.g., `/health`) for monitoring—used like my CloudWatch setup.

89. **How do you integrate a third-party library?**
    - **Answer:** Add dependency in `pom.xml` and configure via `@Bean`.

90. **How would you troubleshoot a misconfigured bean?**
    - **Answer:** Check logs, enable `--debug`, and verify annotations/properties.
