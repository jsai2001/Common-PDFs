  - **Documentation:**[App Service GitHub login](link to doc)

Each provider's endpoint is used for user authentication and token validation.

#### **How Authentication and Authorization Works**

- **Module Execution:** 
  - The authentication module operates in the same sandbox as your application for Windows, but in a separate container for Linux and custom containers.

- **Request Handling:**
  - **Authentication:** Handles user and client authentication with the specified identity provider.
  - **Token Management:** Validates, stores, and refreshes OAuth tokens.
  - **Session Management:** Manages the authenticated session state.
  - **Header Injection:** Injects identity information into HTTP headers.

- **Configuration:**
  - Can be set up via Azure Resource Manager settings or a configuration file, without requiring SDKs or code changes.

- **Platform Independence:**
  - This system is language-agnostic, meaning you don't need to modify your application's code to utilize the authentication features.

**Note for Linux and Containers:**
  - Authentication runs in a separate, isolated container, which means there's no direct in-process integration with language frameworks.

#### **Example Configuration via Azure CLI:**

To enable authentication for an app with Microsoft Entra ID:

```bash
az webapp auth update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> \
  --enabled true --action AllowAnonymous \
  --aad-client-id <client-id> --aad-client-secret <client-secret> \
  --aad-issuer-url <issuer-url>
```

#### **Key Points:**

- **Multiple Providers:** You can configure multiple sign-in options for users.
- **No Code Changes:** Authentication can be enabled without altering your application's codebase.
- **Security Features:** 
  - Token management ensures secure and efficient handling of OAuth tokens.

#### **Conclusion:**

Azure App Service's authentication and authorization capabilities simplify securing your applications by offloading the complexities of identity management to trusted providers. This integration allows for a seamless setup where your application remains focused on its core functionality while the platform handles user identity and security.

### **Authentication Flow in Azure App Service**

#### **Overview:**

- **Provider SDK Usage:** The flow varies based on whether the application uses the identity provider's SDK or relies on App Service for authentication.

#### **Authentication Flow Steps:**

- **Without Provider SDK (Server-Directed Flow):**
  1. **Sign User In:**
     - Redirects to `/.auth/login/<provider>`.

  2. **Post-Authentication:**
     - Provider redirects back to `/.auth/login/<provider>/callback`.

  3. **Establish Authenticated Session:**
     - App Service adds an authenticated cookie to the response.

  4. **Serve Authenticated Content:**
     - Client includes the authentication cookie in subsequent requests (handled by the browser).

- **With Provider SDK (Client-Directed Flow):**
  1. **Sign User In:**
     - Client code uses the provider's SDK to authenticate and receive a token.
     - See provider's documentation for specifics.

  2. **Post-Authentication:**
     - Client code sends the token to `/.auth/login/<provider>` for validation.

  3. **Establish Authenticated Session:**
     - App Service returns its authentication token.

  4. **Serve Authenticated Content:**
     - Client presents the token in the `X-ZUMO-AUTH` header (handled by Mobile Apps client SDKs).

**Note:** For browser clients, App Service can automatically redirect unauthenticated users to `/.auth/login/<provider>`.

#### **Authorization Behavior Configuration:**

- **Allow Unauthenticated Requests:**
  - Authentication is deferred to your application code.
  - Authenticated requests include authentication info in headers.
  - Useful for presenting multiple sign-in options or handling anonymous requests.

- **Require Authentication:**
  - Rejects unauthenticated traffic:
    - **Redirect:** Sends the user to `/.auth/login/<provider>`.
    - **HTTP 401 Unauthorized:** For native mobile apps or when configured to return unauthorized.
    - **HTTP 403 Forbidden:** Can be set as the rejection response.

**Caution:** 
  - Requiring authentication for all calls might not be suitable for apps with public pages, like single-page applications.

#### **Configuration via Azure Portal:**

- **Authentication Settings:**
  - Navigate to your App Service in the Azure portal.
  - Go to **Authentication / Authorization** under **Settings**.
  - **Toggle Authentication:** On.
  - **Choose Action:** Select how to handle unauthenticated requests (Allow or Require).

#### **Example Configuration via Azure CLI:**

To configure App Service to require authentication with redirection:

```bash
az webapp auth update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> \
  --enabled true --action LoginWithMicrosoftAccount
```

#### **Conclusion:**

Azure App Service provides a flexible authentication framework that can operate with or without direct integration with provider SDKs. The choice between server-directed and client-directed flows depends on your application's nature and interaction with users. The authorization settings allow you to control access to your application, balancing between security and user experience.

    az webapp config hostname add --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --hostname <custom-domain>
    ```

  - **Access Restrictions:**
    - Restricts access to your app based on IP addresses.
    ```bash
    # Add an IP restriction
    az webapp config access-restriction add --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --rule-name "AllowSpecificIP" --action Allow --ip-address <ip-address>
    ```

  - **Service Endpoints:**
    - Allows secure access to Azure services like Azure Storage from your app.

  - **Private Endpoints:**
    - Connects your app privately to Azure services or on-premises networks without internet exposure.

  **Outbound Traffic Control:**
  - **Hybrid Connections:**
    - Enables connectivity to on-premises systems securely.
    ```bash
    # Create a Hybrid Connection endpoint
    az relay hybrid-connection create --resource-group <resource-group-name> --namespace-name <namespace-name> --name <hybrid-connection-name> --type HybridConnection
    ```

  - **Gateway-required Virtual Network Integration:**
    - Allows your app to connect to resources in a virtual network via an Azure Application Gateway or a VPN Gateway.

  - **Virtual Network Integration:**
    - Enables your app to access resources within an Azure VNet.

#### **Inbound Use Cases:**

- **SSL Certificate Binding:**
  - **Feature:** App-assigned address for IP-based SSL.

- **Dedicated Inbound Address:**
  - **Feature:** App-assigned address to provide a unique inbound IP.

- **IP Whitelisting:**
  - **Feature:** Access restrictions to allow access only from specific IP addresses.

#### **Notes:**

- **Feature Compatibility:** Mixing features is possible, but there are limitations due to the nature of the multi-tenant environment.
- **Security:** By using these features, you can significantly enhance the security of your applications by controlling who can access them and how they communicate outward.

#### **Conclusion:**

Azure App Service networking features offer a robust set of tools for controlling both inbound and outbound traffic. These features allow developers to tailor network behavior to specific application requirements, ensuring both security and connectivity needs are met without compromising on performance or user experience.

### **Default Networking Behavior in Azure App Service**

#### **Overview:**

- **Scale Units:** Azure App Service runs on scale units that serve multiple customers.

- **VM Types:**
  - **Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, Premium:** Share similar worker VM types.
  - **PremiumV2:** Uses a different VM type.
  - **PremiumV3:** Uses yet another VM type.

#### **Outbound Addresses:**

- **Worker VMs and Outbound IPs:**
  - Apps share outbound IP addresses based on the VM family they run on.
  - Changing to a different VM family (like moving to PremiumV2 or PremiumV3) changes the set of outbound IPs.

- **Address Sharing:**
  - The outbound addresses are used by all apps on the same worker VM family within an App Service deployment.

#### **Finding Outbound IP Information:**

- **Azure Portal:**
  - Navigate to your app in the Azure portal.
  - Go to **Properties** in the left-hand navigation to view current outbound IP addresses.

- **Azure CLI Commands:**

  **Current Outbound IP Addresses:**
  ```bash
  az webapp show \
      --resource-group <group_name> \
      --name <app-name> \
      --query outboundIpAddresses \
      --output tsv
  ```

  **Possible Outbound IP Addresses (for all tiers):**
  ```bash
  az webapp show \
      --resource-group <group_name> \
      --name <app-name> \
      --query possibleOutboundIpAddresses \
      --output tsv
  ```

#### **Notes:**

- **Scaling:** When scaling out, all apps in the same App Service plan are replicated across new instances, but they will share the same set of outbound IPs unless you change VM families.

- **Predictability:** Knowing the possible outbound IPs is useful for firewall rules or when integrating with services that require IP whitelisting.

- **Multi-Tenant Implications:** In multi-tenant environments (Free and Shared), your app might share an outbound IP with other customers' apps, which might not be ideal for some scenarios.

#### **Conclusion:**

Understanding and managing outbound IP addresses in Azure App Service is crucial for applications that need to communicate externally or integrate with services that whitelist IPs. The ability to scale while maintaining or managing these addresses allows for flexible deployment strategies tailored to security and connectivity needs.

### Azure App Service Introduction

#### Key Concept: App Settings

- **Purpose**: App settings in Azure App Service are essentially environment variables that provide a way to configure your application without changing its code.

#### Learning Objectives:

1. **Create Application Settings**:
   - Application settings can be slot-specific or shared across deployment slots:
     ```plaintext
     az webapp config appsettings set --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --slot <slot-name> --settings <key>=<value>
     ```
   - For shared settings across all slots:
     ```plaintext
     az webapp config appsettings set --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --settings <key>=<value>
     ```

2. **SSL/TLS Certificates**:
   - Understanding how to secure your app with SSL/TLS:
     - **Import a certificate**: 
       ```plaintext
       az webapp config ssl import --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --cert-file <path-to-cert-file> --key-file <path-to-key-file> --password <certificate-password>
       ```
     - **Bind certificate to hostname**:
       ```plaintext
       az webapp config ssl bind --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --certificate-thumbprint <thumbprint> --ssl-type SNI
       ```

3. **Enable Diagnostic Logging**:
   - Log configuration for better debugging and monitoring:
     ```plaintext
     az webapp log config --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --application-logging filesystem --detailed-error-messages true --failed-request-tracing true
     ```

4. **Virtual App to Directory Mappings**:
   - Useful for structuring applications with different virtual paths mapping to physical directories:
     ```plaintext
     az webapp config set --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --virtual-applications '[{"virtualPath": "/myapp", "physicalPath": "site\\wwwroot\\myapp"}]'
     ```

**Note**: Always check the latest Azure CLI documentation for any updates or changes to command syntax.

These notes summarize the introduction to Azure App Service settings, focusing on application configuration, security, logging, and application structure management. Remember, each of these operations can be performed through the Azure Portal as well, but using the CLI can streamline your workflow, especially in automated environments or scripts.

#### Key Concepts:

- **Application Settings**: These are environment variables provided to your application code in Azure App Service. For Linux apps and custom containers, these are passed using the `--env` flag.

**Accessing Application Settings:**
- Navigate to your app's management page:
  - Go to **Environment variables** > **Application settings**.

**ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core Usage:**
- App settings in App Service override those in `Web.config` or `appsettings.json`.
- Local settings can be kept in `Web.config` or `appsettings.json`, while production secrets should reside in App Service for security.

**Security:**
- All app settings are encrypted at rest.

#### Adding and Editing Settings:

- **Single Setting Addition**: 
  - Select **+ Add** to add a new setting.
  - If using deployment slots, decide if the setting should be slot-specific or swappable.

- **Bulk Editing/Adding Settings**:
  - Use **Advanced edit** for bulk operations. Here's an example JSON format for app settings:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "name": "<key-1>",
        "value": "<value-1>",
        "slotSetting": false
      },
      {
        "name": "<key-2>",
        "value": "<value-2>",
        "slotSetting": false
      }
    ]
    ```

#### Configure Connection Strings:

- For ASP.NET/ASP.NET Core, connection strings in App Service override those in `Web.config`.
- For other languages, app settings are preferred unless you're using specific Azure database types for backups.

**Bulk Editing Connection Strings:**
- JSON format for connection strings:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "name-1",
      "value": "conn-string-1",
      "type": "SQLServer",
      "slotSetting": false
    },
    {
      "name": "name-2",
      "value": "conn-string-2",
      "type": "PostgreSQL",
      "slotSetting": false
    }
  ]
  ```

**Note for .NET Apps with PostgreSQL:**
- Set the connection string type to **Custom** as a workaround for an issue in .NET.

#### Environment Variables for Custom Containers:

- To set environment variables for custom containers:
  - In **Bash** (Azure CLI):
    ```bash
    az webapp config appsettings set --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name> --settings key1=value1 key2=value2
    ```
  - In **PowerShell** (Azure PowerShell):
    ```powershell
    Set-AzWebApp -ResourceGroupName <group-name> -Name <app-name> -AppSettings @{"DB_HOST"="myownserver.mysql.database.azure.com"}
    ```

- **Verification**:
  - Use the URL `https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/Env` to verify the environment variables in your running container.

Remember, when configuring your app, always apply your changes after editing to ensure they take effect.

#### General Settings Overview:

- Navigate to **Configuration > General settings** to manage these settings.

#### List of Available Settings:

**1. Stack Settings:**
- Define the software stack for your app:
  - Language and SDK versions.
  - For Linux and custom container apps:
    - Optional start-up command or file.

**2. Platform Settings:**

- **Platform Bitness**: Choose between 32-bit or 64-bit for Windows apps.
- **FTP State**: 
  - Options include allowing only FTPS or disabling FTP altogether.
- **HTTP Version**:
  - Set to `2.0` for HTTP/2 protocol support.
  ```plaintext
  # Note: Most browsers support HTTP/2 only over TLS. Ensure your custom DNS is secured for HTTP/2 use.
  ```
  
- **Web Sockets**: Enable for real-time features like ASP.NET SignalR or socket.io.
- **Always On**: 
  - Keeps the app loaded without traffic, preventing cold starts:
  ```plaintext
  # Set to ON for maintaining continuous WebJobs or CRON triggered jobs.
  ```
- **ARR Affinity**: 
  - Ensures session stickiness in multi-instance scenarios:
  ```plaintext
  # Set to OFF for stateless applications.
  ```
- **HTTPS Only**: 
  - Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
- **Minimum TLS Version**: 
  - Choose the minimum TLS version your app will accept.
- **Debugging**: 
  - Enable remote debugging for specified app types. Automatically turns off after 48 hours.
- **Incoming Client Certificates**: 
  - For mutual TLS authentication, forcing clients to provide certificates for access.

**Important Notes:**
- **Scaling**: Some settings might require scaling to higher pricing tiers.
- **HTTP/2**: Remember to secure your custom DNS name for HTTP/2 usage due to TLS requirements in modern browsers.

These settings are crucial for optimizing your application's performance, security, and compatibility with various technologies and protocols. Always consider your application's specific needs when configuring these options.

#### Path Mappings Overview:

- Navigate to **Configuration > Path mappings** to configure handler mappings and virtual applications/directories.

#### Windows Apps (Uncontainerized)

**Handler Mappings:**
- Custom script processors can be added for specific file extensions:
  - **Extension**: File extension to handle (e.g., `*.php`, `handler.fcgi`).
  - **Script processor**: Path to the script processor (e.g., `D:\home\site\wwwroot` for app root).
    ```plaintext
    # Example configuration for a PHP handler:
    # Extension: *.php
    # Script processor: D:\home\site\wwwroot\php-cgi.exe
    # Arguments: (optional)
    ```
  - **Arguments**: Optional command-line arguments.

**Virtual Applications and Directories:**
- Default path `/` is mapped to `D:\home\site\wwwroot`.
- To configure:
  - Specify virtual directory and physical path relative to `D:\home`.
  - Uncheck **Directory** to mark a virtual directory as a web application.

#### Linux and Containerized Apps

**Custom Storage Mounts:**
- For Linux apps and custom containers (both Windows and Linux):
  - Select **New Azure Storage Mount** to add custom storage:

```plaintext
# Basic Configuration
Name: [Display name of the mount]
Storage accounts: [Select your storage account]
Storage type: [Azure Blobs or Azure Files; Windows containers support only Azure Files]
Storage container: [Select the container in basic setup]

# Advanced Configuration
Share name: [File share name for advanced setup]
Access key: [Access key for advanced setup]
Mount path: [Absolute path in container for mount point]
Deployment slot setting: [Check if this should apply to deployment slots]
```

**Notes:**
- **Azure Blobs** can only be mounted as read-only.
- **Deployment Slot Setting** ensures that storage mounts are consistent across deployment slots when checked.

These configurations allow you to customize how your application handles different file types and how it interacts with external storage, enhancing both functionality and performance based on your operational needs.

### Enable Diagnostic Logging

#### Diagnostic Logging Overview:

- Azure provides various types of logs to help debug and monitor your App Service applications. Here's a breakdown:

| **Type**                | **Platform** | **Location**                               | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|-------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Application logging     | Windows, Linux | App Service file system and/or Azure Storage blobs | Logs messages from your application code.

**Notes:**
- **Application Logging**: 
  ```plaintext
  # You can configure this to log to the file system or Azure Blob storage.
  # Example configurations might involve setting up log levels and destinations:
  # az webapp log config --application-logging true --level information --web-server-logging filesystem
  ```

- **Web Server Logging**: 
  ```plaintext
  # Can be stored in the file system or Azure Blob storage.
  # az webapp log config --web-server-logging filesystem
  ```

- **Detailed Error Messages** and **Failed Request Tracing** are specific to Windows and offer deep insights into application errors and performance issues.

- **Deployment Logging**: 
  ```plaintext
  # This is automatic upon deployment, no configuration needed.
  ```

### Enable Application Logging

#### For Windows:

- To enable application logging for Windows apps:
  - Navigate to your app in the Azure portal.
  - Select **App Service logs**.

**Configuration Options:**
- **Application Logging (Filesystem)**:
  - Set to **On** for temporary debugging. Automatically turns off after 12 hours.
  - This is useful for quick, short-term troubleshooting.

- **Application Logging (Blob)**:
  - Set to **On** for long-term logging.
  - Requires a blob storage container. Here's how you might set it up:
    ```plaintext
    # Example Blob storage configuration
    # az webapp log config --application-logging blob --level information --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name>
    # --blob-storage-account <storage-account-name> --blob-container <container-name>
    ```

**Log Levels:**
- Set the logging level for detail control:
  ```plaintext
  # Log Levels:
  # - Disabled: No logging
  # - Error: Errors and Critical
  # - Warning: Warnings, Errors, and Critical
  # - Information: Info, Warning, Error, Critical
  # - Verbose: All categories (Trace, Debug, Info, Warning, Error, Critical)
  ```

- **After configuration, remember to select **Save** to apply changes.**

**Note:**
- If you regenerate storage account keys, you must:
  - Turn logging off and then on again to update the configuration with the new keys.

#### For Linux/Container:

- In **App Service logs**:
  - Set **Application logging** to **File System**.

**Quota and Retention:**
- **Quota (MB)**: Define the disk space allowed for logs.
  ```plaintext
  # Example configuration for quota
  # az webapp log config --application-logging filesystem --level information --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --quota 100
  ```

- **Retention Period (Days)**: Specify how long logs should be kept.
  ```plaintext
  # Example for retention period
  # az webapp log config --retention-in-days 7
  ```

- **When finished, select **Save** to apply the settings.**

These steps ensure you have the appropriate logging enabled for your Windows or Linux/Container apps in Azure, providing you with the necessary logs for debugging or monitoring purposes. Remember, for Linux apps, logs are only saved to the file system, not to Azure Blob Storage.

### Enable Web Server Logging

- To configure web server logging:
  - Select **Storage** for logs to be stored in blob storage, or **File System** for on-site storage on the App Service.

**Retention Period:**
- Set the **Retention Period (Days)** for how long logs should be kept.
  ```plaintext
  # Example for setting retention period
  # az webapp log config --web-server-logging filesystem --retention-in-days 30
  ```

- **When finished, select **Save** to apply the settings.**

### Add Log Messages in Code

**For ASP.NET:**
```csharp
System.Diagnostics.Trace.TraceError("If you're seeing this, something bad happened");
```

**For ASP.NET Core:**
- Uses `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.AzureAppServices` by default.

**For Python:**
- Use the `OpenCensus` package to send logs.

### Stream Logs

- **Azure Portal**: 
  - Navigate to your app and select **Log stream**.

- **Azure CLI**: Use for live streaming in Cloud Shell:
  ```bash
  az webapp log tail --name appname --resource-group myResourceGroup
  ```

- **Local Console**:
  - Install Azure CLI, sign in, and follow the Azure CLI instructions.

### Access Log Files

**If using Azure Storage for Logs:**
- You'll need a client tool that works with Azure Storage to access the logs.

**For App Service File System Logs:**

- **Download Logs for Linux/Container Apps:**
  ```plaintext
  # URL for downloading logs
  # https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/api/logs/docker/zip
  ```

- **Download Logs for Windows Apps:**
  ```plaintext
  # URL for downloading logs
  # https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/api/dump
  ```

**Notes:**
- For Linux/containers, the ZIP contains logs from both the docker host and container. For scaled-out apps, there's one set per instance.
- Logs are located in the `/home/LogFiles` directory on the App Service.

This setup allows you to configure where and how long logs are kept, log from within your application, stream logs in real-time, and retrieve them for analysis. Remember, some logs might not be in chronological order due to buffering.

### Configure Security Certificates

#### Overview:

- Azure App Service provides various options to manage certificates for securing data transmission:

| **Option**                               | **Description**                                                                                         |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Create a free App Service managed certificate | A no-cost private certificate for securing custom domains within App Service.                           |
| Purchase an App Service certificate      | A managed private certificate by Azure with features like automated management and flexible renewals.   |
| Import a certificate from Key Vault     | Suitable for integrating with Azure Key Vault for centralized certificate management.                   |
| Upload a private certificate            | For pre-existing certificates from third-party providers, you can upload directly to App Service.        |
| Upload a public certificate             | For public certificates needed in application code, not for domain security.                            |

#### Private Certificate Requirements:

- For certificates to be used in App Service, they must:

  - Be exported as a **password-protected PFX file** using triple DES encryption.
  - Have a **private key** of at least 2048 bits in length.
  - Include **all intermediate certificates** and the **root certificate** in the chain.

- For securing a custom domain with TLS binding, additional requirements are:

  - Must have an **Extended Key Usage** for server authentication (OID = 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1).
  - Be signed by a **trusted certificate authority**.

**Notes:**
- Certificates uploaded to an app are stored within the deployment unit linked to the app service plan's resource group and region, making them available for other apps sharing the same environment.

This configuration ensures your application's data in transit is secure, using certificates either provided by Azure or brought in from external sources. Remember, when dealing with custom domains, the certificate must meet specific criteria for TLS/SSL bindings.

### Creating a Free Managed Certificate

**App Service Plan Requirements:**
- Your App Service plan must be at least in the **Basic** tier (Standard, Premium, or Isolated also work).

**Steps to Create a Free Managed Certificate:**

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - **Custom DNS Configuration**: Ensure your custom domain is correctly set up with Azure App Service.
   - **CAA Record**: For some domains, you'll need to add a CAA record to allow DigiCert to issue certificates:
     ```plaintext
     0 issue digicert.com
     ```

2. **Certificate Management**:
   - Azure App Service will handle:
     - Certificate issuance by DigiCert.
     - Automatic renewal every six months, 45 days before expiration.

3. **Limitations**:
   - **No Wildcard Certificates**: You cannot use this for wildcard domains like `*.example.com`.
   - **Not for Client Certificates**: Cannot be used with client certificate authentication by thumbprint.
   - **No Private DNS**: Does not work with private DNS zones.
   - **Non-Exportable**: These certificates are managed by Azure and cannot be exported.
   - **ASE Incompatible**: Not supported in App Service Environment.
   - **Character Restrictions**: Only supports alphanumeric characters, dashes (-), and periods (.), with a maximum length of 64 characters for the domain name.

**Key Considerations:**
- **Avoid Certificate Pinning**: Since Azure manages these certificates, the root issuer or other aspects might change, so don't pin to specific certificate details.

This solution provides an effortless way to secure your custom domain in Azure App Service, but be mindful of its limitations, especially if you require more advanced certificate management features.

### Importing an App Service Certificate

**Azure Management for Purchased App Service Certificates:**

- **Purchase**: Azure handles the procurement from the certificate provider.
- **Verification**: Automatically verifies the domain for the certificate.
- **Storage**: Stores the certificate in **Azure Key Vault**.
- **Renewal**: Manages the renewal process.
- **Synchronization**: Automatically updates or synchronizes the certificate across your App Service apps.

**Actions with an Existing App Service Certificate:**

- **Import**: You can import your App Service Certificate into Azure App Service:
  ```plaintext
  # Example command to import a certificate:
  # az webapp config ssl import --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --certificate-name <certificate-name> --key-vault <key-vault-name> --key-vault-certificate-name <vault-certificate-name>
  ```

- **Management**:
  - **Renew**: Extend the validity of your certificate.
  - **Rekey**: Generate a new key pair for the certificate, useful if you suspect key compromise.
  - **Export**: Export the certificate for use elsewhere if needed, although direct export from Azure might not be straightforward, you can download it from Key Vault.

**Important Note:**
- **Azure National Clouds**: App Service Certificates are **not supported** in these environments.

This functionality provides a straightforward method for managing SSL/TLS certificates within Azure, simplifying the process of securing your web applications with minimal manual intervention after the initial setup.

## Best Practices:
- **Set Realistic Thresholds**: Too low might lead to unnecessary scaling, too high might degrade performance.
- **Use Sensible Cool Down Periods**: Prevents rapid, costly fluctuations.
- **Test Autoscale Settings**: Simulate load to ensure autoscaling works as expected.

These notes cover the essentials of autoscaling in Azure, including why it's useful, how to implement it, and what to monitor after implementation. Remember, the actual metrics and thresholds you'll use will depend on your specific application's needs and behavior.

# Azure Autoscaling & Automatic Scaling

## Autoscaling Overview
- **Definition**: Autoscaling is a mechanism to adjust resources based on demand.
- **Functionality**: Scales **in** or **out** (not up or down).
  - **Triggers**: 
    - **Schedule-based**
    - **Metric-based** (e.g., CPU, memory, requests)

## Azure App Service Scaling Options

### 1. **Autoscaling with Azure Autoscale**
   - **Mechanism**: Uses rules defined by the user to scale.
   - **Purpose**: Adds or removes resources to meet demands.

### 2. **Azure App Service Automatic Scaling**
   - **Mechanism**: Automatically scales based on selected parameters without user-defined rules.

## Azure App Service Autoscaling Features
- **Monitors**: Resource metrics like CPU, memory, etc.
- **Action**: 
  - Adds or removes **web servers**
  - Balances load across servers
- **Does Not**: Change individual server's CPU, memory, or storage capacity.

## Key Points
- **Scaling Direction**: 
  - **Out**: Adds more instances
  - **In**: Reduces instances
- **Response**: Proactive to ensure resources are available before overload occurs.

Remember, with Azure App Service, you're not just throwing more hardware at the problem; you're smartly managing your cloud resources to match your app's workload!

# Azure Autoscaling Rules

## Rule Definition
- **Purpose**: Define thresholds for metrics to trigger scaling events.
- **Components**:
  - **Trigger**: Metric crossing a specified threshold.
  - **Action**: Scale **in** or **out** accordingly.

### Considerations for Rules:
- **DoS Protection**: Avoid scaling in response to malicious traffic spikes. Instead:
  - Implement request filtering and detection mechanisms.

## When to Use Autoscaling

### Benefits:
- **Elasticity**: Scales with workload changes, ideal for:
  - Holiday traffic spikes in e-commerce.
- **Availability & Fault Tolerance**:
  - Prevents request denial due to instance overload or crash.

### Limitations:
- **Resource-Intensive Requests**: 
  - If each request requires significant processing:
    ```markdown
    - Autoscaling might not suffice; consider manual scaling up instead.
    ```
- **Long-Term Growth**: 
  - Autoscaling has monitoring overhead. Manual scaling might be more cost-effective for predictable growth.

### Instance Count:
- **Few Instances**: 
  - Limited initial capacity can lead to service downtime despite autoscaling.

## Best Practices:
- **Careful Rule Settings**: Ensure rules do not misinterpret malicious traffic as legitimate load.
- **Evaluate Workload**: Determine if autoscaling meets your application's processing demands or if manual intervention is needed.

- **Monitor and Adjust**: Regularly review autoscaling performance against your app's real-world demands to optimize cost and performance.

Remember, autoscaling is not a one-size-fits-all solution. It's about having the right number of servers at the right time, not necessarily about having the most powerful servers all the time.

# Azure App Service Automatic Scaling

## Overview:
- **Purpose**: Automatically manages scale-out decisions for web apps and App Service Plans.
- **Difference from Azure Autoscale**: 
  - **Autoscale**: User-defined rules based on schedules/resources.
  - **Automatic Scaling**: Platform makes decisions based on app performance needs.

## Features:
- **Prewarming**: 
  - The system prewarms instances to buffer performance during scale-out events.
- **Billing**: 
  - **Per-second**: You're charged for each instance, including prewarmed ones.

## When to Use Automatic Scaling:

1. **Simplified Configuration**:
   - If you wish to avoid the complexity of setting up and managing autoscale rules.

2. **Independent Scaling**:
   - When you need different web apps within the same App Service Plan to scale independently.

3. **Backend Integration**:
   - For web apps linked with slower-scaling backends like databases or legacy systems:
     - **Setting Limits**: You can define a maximum number of instances to prevent overwhelming backend resources.

## Key Points:
- Automatic scaling aims to:
  - **Improve Performance**: By avoiding cold starts and ensuring smooth performance transitions.
  - **Balance Load**: Automatically adjusts to the workload without manual rule setting.

Remember, with automatic scaling, you're paying for flexibility and performance. Every second counts, quite literally!

# Azure Autoscaling Factors

## Purpose of Autoscaling:
- **Ensure Resources**: Available for high demand periods.
- **Cost Management**: Scale back during low demand.

## Configuration Options:
- **Resource-Based Scaling**:
  - Scales based on metrics like CPU usage, memory, etc.
- **Schedule-Based Scaling**:
  - Scales according to predefined time schedules.

## Understanding Autoscaling in App Service Plans:

### **App Service Plan and Autoscaling**:
- Autoscaling is tied to the **App Service Plan** (ASP) configuration of the web app.
  - **Scaling Out**: Azure provisions new hardware instances as specified by the ASP.

### **Instance Limits**:
- **Prevent Over-Scaling**: Each ASP has a limit on how many instances can be created:
  - **Pricing Tier**: Determines the maximum number of instances for autoscaling.

### **Important Note**:
- **Tier Limitations**: Not all pricing tiers of the App Service Plan support autoscaling. Check your plan's capabilities before relying on autoscaling.

## Key Takeaways:
- **Metrics**: Use resource metrics smartly to trigger scaling events.
- **Scheduling**: Anticipate regular demand changes with schedule-based autoscaling.
- **Plan Limits**: Be aware of your App Service Plan's instance limit to manage expectations and costs.

# Autoscale Conditions in Azure

## Autoscaling Options:
- **Metric-Based Scaling**: 
  - **Example Metrics**: 
    - Disk queue length
    - Number of HTTP requests pending
- **Schedule-Based Scaling**: 
  - **Example**: Scale out at specific times/days, with an end date for scaling back in.

## Combining Scaling Approaches:
- Can combine both metric and schedule-based scaling for more nuanced control.
  - **Example**: Scale out based on HTTP requests but only during business hours.

## Multiple Conditions:
- **Multiple Rules**: Different conditions can be set for various scenarios.
- **Default Condition**: Always active if other conditions don't apply; no schedule needed.

## Metrics for Autoscale Rules:
- **CPU Percentage**: Indicates CPU utilization across instances.
  - High value = potential for processing delays.
- **Memory Percentage**: Shows memory usage.
  - High value = risk of memory depletion.
- **Disk Queue Length**: Measures outstanding I/O requests.
  - High value = potential disk contention.
- **Http Queue Length**: Shows pending HTTP requests.
  - Large number = risk of HTTP 408 errors.
- **Data In/Out**: Monitors network traffic in and out.

### Cross-Service Metrics:
- Can also scale based on metrics from other Azure services, e.g., Azure Service Bus Queue length.

## Key Points:
- **Autoscale Rules**: Define when to scale based on metrics.
- **Flexibility**: Combine rules to match your app's unique traffic patterns and resource needs.
- **Monitoring**: Keep an eye on multiple dimensions to ensure your app scales appropriately.

Remember, setting up autoscaling is like setting up a smart thermostat for your app's environment - it keeps everything at just the right level without you having to do much more than define the comfort zones.

# How Autoscale Rules Analyze Metrics

## Metric Analysis Steps:

### 1. **Time Grain Aggregation**:
- **Definition**: Aggregates metric values for all instances over a short time period.
  - **Typical Time Grain**: 1 minute.
  - **Aggregation Options**: 
    - Average
    - Minimum
    - Maximum
    - Sum
    - Last
    - Count

### 2. **Duration Aggregation**:
- **Purpose**: To assess if changes are significant enough for scaling.
  - **Duration**: User-defined period, minimum of 5 minutes.
  - **Example**: If Duration is 10 minutes, it aggregates 10 time grain values.

  - **Aggregation Method**: Can differ from time grain aggregation.
    - **Example**: 
      - Time Grain: Average CPU%
      - Duration Aggregation: Maximum of those averages over 10 minutes.

## Autoscale Actions:

- **Scale-Out**: Increases instance count.
- **Scale-In**: Reduces instance count.
- **Operators**: 
  - `>` for scale-out (when metric exceeds threshold)
  - `<` for scale-in (when metric falls below threshold)
- **Set Instance Count**: Can also directly set the number of instances.

### Cooldown Period:
- **Definition**: Time frame post-action where no new scaling occurs.
  - **Purpose**: Allows system stabilization.
  - **Minimum**: 5 minutes.

## Key Points:
- Autoscaling involves **trend analysis** over time.
- **Time Grain** helps in quick response to changes.
- **Duration** ensures that the change isn't just a blip.
- **Cooldown** prevents overreaction to temporary spikes or drops in metrics.

Remember, autoscaling is like adjusting sails on a boat; you're looking at the wind (metrics) over time, not just the gusts (momentary spikes), and you give the ship (your app) time to adjust to the new direction before making another change.

# Pairing and Combining Autoscale Rules

## **Paired Autoscale Rules**:
- **Strategy**: Define rules in pairs for both scaling out and in.
  - **Scale-Out Rule**: Triggers when metrics exceed an upper limit.
  - **Scale-In Rule**: Triggers when metrics fall below a lower limit.

## **Combining Autoscale Rules**:

### **Example Configuration**:

```markdown
- **Rules within one condition**:
  - **Scale Out**:
    - HTTP queue length > 10 → Add 1 instance
    - CPU utilization > 70% → Add 1 instance
  - **Scale In**:
    - HTTP queue length = 0 → Remove 1 instance
    - CPU utilization < 50% → Remove 1 instance
```

### **Rule Execution**:
- **Scaling Out**: Occurs if **any** of the scale-out conditions are met.
- **Scaling In**: Only happens when **all** scale-in conditions are true.

### **Separate Conditions for Different Logic**:
- If individual scale-in rules should trigger independently, they must be in **separate autoscale conditions**.

## **Key Points**:
- **Pairing**: Helps manage both increase and decrease in workload efficiently.
- **Combining**: Allows for more complex scaling behavior tailored to different scenarios.
- **Condition Logic**:
  - Use OR logic for scaling out (any condition can trigger).
  - Use AND logic for scaling in (all conditions must be met) unless specified otherwise.

Remember, with autoscaling, you're not just telling your app to grow or shrink; you're teaching it when to hibernate or when to go full Hulk mode, ensuring it's always just the right size for the task at hand.

  ![Overview Metrics](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/training/wwl-azure/scale-apps-app-service/media/service-plan-metrics.png)

## **Key Actions**:

- **Create**: Define rules with specific metrics and conditions for scaling.
- **Monitor**: Use Azure's tools to review and analyze autoscaling events and resource metrics.

Remember, setting up scale rules is like fine-tuning an engine; you adjust the parameters until your application runs smoothly, scaling appropriately with the demands placed upon it.

### Azure Autoscale Notes

**Autoscale Concepts:**

- **Horizontal Scaling:** 
  - **Scale Out:** Increase the number of instances when demand grows.
  - **Scale In:** Decrease the number of instances when demand reduces.
  - An autoscale setting includes:
    - **Maximum Instances:** The upper limit of instances.
    - **Minimum Instances:** The lower limit of instances.
    - **Default Instances:** The starting number of instances before any scaling occurs.

**Threshold Mechanics:**

- Autoscale operates by monitoring metrics:
  - It checks if the metric (like CPU usage) has exceeded a threshold.
  - For example:
    ```plaintext
    "scale out by one instance when average CPU > 80% when instance count is 2"
    ```
    - This means, if the average CPU usage across all instances exceeds 80% with currently 2 instances, add one more instance.

**Monitoring and Logging:**

- **Activity Log:** 
  - All scaling actions, successful or not, are logged here.
  - You can set up alerts for:
    - **Email**
    - **SMS**
    - **Webhooks**

**Best Practices:**

- **Avoid Conflicting Rules:** Ensure your autoscale rules do not counteract each other, causing unnecessary scaling actions.

These practices help in managing your resources efficiently, ensuring your systems scale appropriately with workload demands while avoiding over or under-provisioning. Remember, the last thing you want is your server farm looking like a yo-yo at a children's party – up and down, up and down. Keep those scales balanced, my friend!

### Azure Autoscale Best Practices

**Setting Instance Limits:**

- **Margin Between Limits:** Ensure there's a gap between your `minimum` and `maximum` instance settings. If both are set to `2`, no scaling will occur. Here's an example:

  ```plaintext
  minimum=2
  maximum=5
  ```

**Diagnostic Metric Selection:**

- **Statistic for Scaling:** Choose from `Average`, `Minimum`, `Maximum`, or `Total` when setting up autoscale based on metrics. Typically, `Average` is used.

  ```plaintext
  metric_statistic = 'Average'
  ```

**Threshold Selection:**

- **Avoid Similar Thresholds:** Do not set autoscale thresholds too close for scale-out and scale-in. This can lead to an oscillating effect known as "flapping."

  **Bad Example:**

  ```plaintext
  scale_out_threshold = 600  # When thread count >= 600
  scale_in_threshold = 600   # When thread count <= 600
  ```

  **Better Practice:**

  ```plaintext
  scale_out_threshold = 80  # When CPU% >= 80%
  scale_in_threshold = 60   # When CPU% <= 60%
  ```

**Preventing "Flapping":**

- Autoscale uses estimation to prevent unnecessary scaling:
  - When considering scaling in, it calculates if scaling out would be immediate upon scaling in:
    
    ```plaintext
    If current CPU% is 60 across 3 instances:
    60 x 3 = 180 threads total
    180 / 2 (after scaling in) = 90 threads per instance
    ```
    - Since 90 is above the scale-out threshold, it won't scale in to avoid flapping.

**Example Scenario:**

- **Starting Point:** 2 instances
- **Scale Out:** CPU hits 80%, a third instance is added.
- **Scale In Consideration:** CPU drops to 60%, but the system estimates:
  
  ```plaintext
  60 x 3 = 180 total / 2 = 90 threads per instance after scaling in
  ```
  
  - No scale-in occurs because 90 is still near the scale-out threshold.
- **Next Check:** CPU drops further to 50%, estimation now allows scale-in:

  ```plaintext
  50 x 3 = 150 total / 2 = 75 threads per instance
  ```
  
  - Now, scaling in to 2 instances is performed as 75 is below the scale-out threshold.

**Conclusion:**

- Always ensure there's a buffer between your scale-out and scale-in thresholds to prevent rapid back-and-forth scaling actions. This not only saves resources but also keeps your system's stability in check. Remember, your servers should scale like a well-oiled machine, not like the mood swings of a teenager.

### Azure Autoscale Considerations for Multiple Rules

**Multiple Rules in a Profile:**

- **Scale-Out:** Autoscale will scale out if **any** of the scale-out rules are met.
- **Scale-In:** Autoscale will only scale in if **all** scale-in rules are satisfied.

**Example with Four Rules:**

- **Scale-Out Rules:**
  - CPU > 75%, scale out by 1
  - Memory > 75%, scale out by 1

- **Scale-In Rules:**
  - CPU < 30%, scale in by 1
  - Memory < 50%, scale in by 1

  **Scenarios:**

  - **Scale-Out Cases:**
    - CPU at 76% and Memory at 50% -> Scale out (One rule met)
    - CPU at 50% and Memory at 76% -> Scale out (One rule met)

  - **No Scale-In Cases:**
    - CPU at 25% but Memory at 51% -> No scale in (Both rules not met)

  - **Scale-In Case:**
    - CPU at 29% and Memory at 49% -> Scale in (Both rules met)

**Default Instance Count:**

- **Importance:** Set a safe default instance count. This count is used when metrics are unavailable for scaling decisions.
  - **Example:**

    ```plaintext
    default_instance_count = 3  # Choose based on minimal safe operation level
    ```

**Autoscale Notifications:**

- **Activity Log:** Autoscale logs these events:
  - When it issues a scale operation.
  - Successful completion of a scale action.
  - Failure to scale.
  - When metrics are unavailable or become available again.

- **Setting Up Alerts:**
  - Use Activity Log alerts to monitor the autoscale engine's health.
  - Configure notifications for successful scale actions:
    
    ```plaintext
    notifications {
      email: ["admin@example.com", "support@example.com"],
      webhook: "https://example.com/autoscale-webhook"
    }
    ```

**Conclusion:**

- When configuring multiple rules, remember that scale-out is more lenient while scale-in requires all conditions to be met to avoid unnecessary scaling. Ensure your default instance count is set to handle your workload safely when metrics fail. And don't forget to set up notifications; it's always good to know when your system decides to grow or shrink, just like keeping tabs on whether your garden needs watering or not.

### Azure App Service Deployment Slots Overview

**What are Deployment Slots?**

- Deployment slots in Azure App Service provide a staging environment where you can deploy your app before swapping it into production. This minimizes downtime and risk during application updates.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Slot Swapping:** The process of switching the environment (staging to production or vice versa) without downtime.

- **Manual Traffic Routing:** Allows you to control the flow of traffic to different slots for testing purposes.

- **Automatic Traffic Routing:** Can be set up to automatically route traffic based on certain conditions or rules.

**How Slot Swapping Works:**

- When you swap slots:
  1. The staging slot's content becomes the new production content.
  2. The old production content moves to the staging slot, allowing for rollback if necessary.

  ```plaintext
  # Pseudocode for a slot swap
  swap_slots(sourceSlotName="staging", targetSlotName="production")
  ```

**Manual Traffic Routing:**

- You can manually route traffic to test new features or changes in a staging environment.

  ```plaintext
  # Example of routing 50% of traffic to staging
  set_traffic_route(productionSlot="production", stagingSlot="staging", percentage=50)
  ```

**Automatic Traffic Routing:**

- Automate traffic based on conditions like:
  - Time of day (e.g., sending more traffic to staging during low-traffic hours).
  - Performance metrics (if staging performs better, gradually shift more traffic).

  ```plaintext
  # Example of setting up an automatic rule
  add_automatic_routing_rule(condition="timeOfDay", startTime="22:00", endTime="06:00", targetSlot="staging")
  ```

**Benefits of Using Slots:**

- **Zero Downtime Deployment:** Swap environments without taking the app offline.
- **Easy Rollback:** If something goes wrong, swap back to the previous state.
- **Testing in Production:** Test new versions with real-world data and traffic patterns.

**Steps to Perform a Swap:**

1. **Deploy:** Push your new version to a staging slot.
2. **Test:** Validate in the staging environment.
3. **Swap:** Use Azure portal or CLI to swap the slots.

   ```plaintext
   # CLI command for slot swapping
   az webapp deployment slot swap --resource-group MyResourceGroup --name MyWebApp --slot staging
   ```

**Conclusion:**

Deployment slots in Azure App Service are your magic wand for seamless application updates. They allow you to experiment in a production-like setting without affecting your live website, ensuring that your app deployment is as smooth as a jazz tune. Remember, with great power comes great responsibility—use slots wisely to avoid any production blues.

### Azure App Service Deployment Slots Introduction

**Overview:**

**Learning Objectives:**

- **Understand Benefits:** Learn why using deployment slots is advantageous for application management.
- **Slot Swapping:** Grasp the mechanism behind swapping slots in App Service.
- **Manual vs Auto Swap:** Know how to manually swap slots and set up auto-swapping.
- **Traffic Management:** Learn techniques for routing traffic both manually and automatically.

**Key Points:**

- **Benefits of Deployment Slots:**
  - **Zero-downtime deployments**: Update your app without interrupting service.
  - **Testing in Production Environment**: Test with real user traffic without affecting the live app.
  - **Easy Rollback**: Revert changes by swapping back if issues arise post-deployment.

- **Slot Swapping Mechanics:**
  - Swap operation moves the content from one slot (usually staging) to another (production).
  - Example swap command:

    ```plaintext
    az webapp deployment slot swap --resource-group MyResourceGroup --name MyWebApp --slot staging
    ```

- **Manual Swap and Auto Swap:**
  - **Manual Swap:** Directly control when to swap using the Azure portal, CLI, or API.
  - **Auto Swap:** Configure auto-swapping to occur when certain conditions are met, like after successful deployment.

    ```plaintext
    # Enable auto swap for a slot
    az webapp deployment slot auto-swap --name MyWebApp --resource-group MyResourceGroup --slot staging --enable
    ```

- **Traffic Routing:**
  - **Manual Routing:** Use for A/B testing, where you control how much traffic goes to each slot.

    ```plaintext
    # Route 30% traffic to staging slot
    az webapp traffic-routing set --name MyWebApp --resource-group MyResourceGroup --distribution staging=30 production=70
    ```

  - **Automatic Routing:** Set rules or use Azure Traffic Manager for dynamic traffic distribution based on performance or other metrics.

**Prerequisites:**

- Prior experience with Azure portal to ensure you're familiar with managing App Service web apps.

**Conclusion:**

Deployment slots are like having a safety net for your app updates, allowing you to juggle different versions of your application with the finesse of a circus performer. This module sets you up to not only manage your app's lifecycle with ease but also to do it with the confidence of knowing you can always catch your app with the net if it falls.

### Staging Environments in Azure App Service

**Overview:**

- Deployment slots are available in Standard, Premium, and Isolated tiers, allowing deployment to environments other than the default production slot.

**Benefits of Using Staging Slots:**

- **Pre-Deployment Testing:** Validate changes before they hit production.
  
  ```plaintext
  // Pseudo-code for deploying to a staging slot
  deploy_to_slot(appName="MyWebApp", slotName="staging", source="dev-branch")
  ```

- **Warm-Up:** Ensures all instances of the slot are warmed up before going live, avoiding downtime:

  ```plaintext
  # Pseudo-code for warming up instances
  warm_up_instances(slotName="staging")
  ```

- **Seamless Traffic Redirection:** Swapping slots redirects traffic instantly without losing requests.

- **Rollback Capability:** Swap back to the previous version if something goes wrong:

  ```plaintext
  # Pseudo-code for rollback
  swap_slots(sourceSlot="production", targetSlot="staging")
  ```

- **Automation:** Auto-swap can be configured for immediate production deployment post-validation.

  ```plaintext
  # Pseudo-code to enable auto-swap
  enable_auto_swap(slotName="staging")
  ```

**Slot Management:**

- **Slot Limitations:** 
  - Each tier supports a different number of slots. Check App Service limits for your tier's capacity.
  - Scaling down requires the new tier to support the current slot number.

**Slot Creation and Configuration:**

- **Content:** New slots start empty but can be cloned from another slot for settings.
  
  ```plaintext
  # Pseudo-code to clone settings from production
  clone_slot_settings(productionSlot="production", newSlot="staging")
  ```

- **Deployment:** Deploy different versions or branches to staging slots for testing.

**Important Notes:**

- When scaling your app, ensure the target tier supports your current slot usage. For instance, Standard tier supports up to five slots.

- Deployment slots provide a safe playground for your app's updates. Think of them as your app's dress rehearsal room where it can perform without the audience until it's showtime in production.

### Slot Swapping in Azure App Service

**Slot Swapping Process:**

1. **Configuration Application:**
   - Apply settings from the target slot (e.g., production) to the source slot (e.g., staging):
     - Slot-specific settings like app settings and connection strings.
     - Continuous deployment settings.
     - App Service authentication settings.
     
     ```plaintext
     # Pseudo-code for applying settings
     apply_target_settings(sourceSlot="staging")
     ```

   - This triggers a restart of all instances in the source slot.

2. **Restart Validation:**
   - Wait for all instances in the source slot to restart successfully. If an instance fails, the swap reverts.

3. **Local Cache Initialization:**
   - If local cache is enabled, an HTTP request to `/` on each instance initializes the cache, causing another restart.

   ```plaintext
   # Pseudo-code for local cache initialization
   init_local_cache(slot="staging")
   ```

4. **Application Warm-Up:**
   - If auto swap with custom warm-up is enabled, hit `/` to warm up the application:

   ```plaintext
   # Pseudo-code for application warm-up
   warm_up_application(slot="staging")
   ```

5. **Swap Execution:**
   - Once all instances are warmed up, swap the routing rules of the slots:

   ```plaintext
   # Pseudo-code for executing the swap
   execute_slot_swap(sourceSlot="staging", targetSlot="production")
   ```

6. **Post-Swap Actions:**
   - Apply the original target slot's settings to what is now the new source slot, ensuring consistency.

**Key Considerations:**

- **No Downtime:** The target slot remains online during the swap process, ensuring no downtime for production.
- **Swap Direction:** Always swap into the production slot as the target to minimize impact on live traffic.
- **Configuration Cloning:** When cloning config, remember:
  - **Content-Following Settings:** These settings move with the app during a swap.
  - **Slot-Specific Settings:** These stay with their respective slots after a swap.

**Configuration Elements During Swap:**

- **App Settings:** Slot specific unless marked to stick with content.
- **Connection Strings:** Similar to app settings, can be configured to follow content or remain slot-specific.
- **Publishing Profile:** Stays with the slot.

**Conclusion:**

Slot swapping in Azure is like performing a magic trick. You wave your wand (execute the swap), and suddenly your staging slot's content appears in production without the audience (your users) noticing any downtime. Just make sure you've got your hat (configuration) straight before pulling the rabbit (your app) out.

### Configuration Settings in Azure App Service Slot Swapping

**Swappable vs. Non-Swappable Settings:**

- **Settings That Are Swapped:**
  - General settings like framework version, 32/64-bit architecture, and WebSockets.
  - **App Settings:** Can be configured to stick to a slot or follow content to a new slot.
  
    ```plaintext
    # Example of an app setting that follows content
    WEBSITE_NODE_DEFAULT_VERSION=12.13.0
    ```
  
  - **Connection Strings:** Similar to app settings, can be set to stick to a slot or swap with the app.
    
    ```plaintext
    # Example of a connection string
    SQLAZURECONNSTR_defaultConnection=Server=tcp:servername.database.windows.net,1433;Database=databaseName;User ID=userName;Password=password;Trusted_Connection=False;Encrypt=True;
    ```
    
  - Handler mappings.
  - Public certificates.
  - WebJobs content.
  - Path mappings.

- **Settings That Aren't Swapped:**
  - Publishing endpoints.
  - Custom domain names.
  - Non-public certificates and TLS/SSL settings.
  - Scale settings.
  - WebJobs schedulers.
  - IP restrictions.
  - Always On settings.
  - **Azure Content Delivery Network** (planned to be unswapped).
  - **Service Endpoints** (planned to be unswapped).
  - Diagnostic log settings.
  - Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS).
  - Virtual network integration.
  - Managed identities.
  - Settings ending with `_EXTENSION_VERSION`.

**Making Settings Swappable:**

- To override the default behavior where certain settings are sticky to slots:
  
  ```plaintext
  # App setting to override sticky slot settings
  WEBSITE_OVERRIDE_PRESERVE_DEFAULT_STICKY_SLOT_SETTINGS=0
  ```

  This setting should be added to every slot. Setting it to `0` or `false` makes all settings swappable.

**Configuring Slot-Specific Settings:**

- To make an app setting or connection string slot-specific (not swappable):
  - Navigate to the slot's **Configuration** page.
  - Add or edit the setting.
  - Check the **Deployment slot setting** box.

    ```plaintext
    # Setting a slot-specific app setting (example)
    APPSETTING_DEBUG=true [Deployment Slot Setting]
    ```

**Note:**

- Managed identities are always slot-specific and are not affected by the override setting.

**Conclusion:**

In Azure App Service, you can tailor how settings behave during slot swaps, giving you the flexibility to keep certain configurations consistent across environments while allowing others to adapt. Think of it like setting the stage: you want the backdrop (slot-specific settings) to remain, but you're swapping the actors (your app) and their props (content and swappable settings) for a new scene.

### Manual Slot Swapping in Azure App Service

**Steps to Swap Deployment Slots:**

1. **Access the Deployment Slots Page:**
   - Navigate to your app in Azure portal, then to the **Deployment slots** page.

2. **Initiate Swap:**
   - Click on **Swap** to open the swap dialog.

     ```plaintext
     # Pseudo-code for initiating a swap
     initiate_swap(sourceSlot="staging", targetSlot="production")
     ```

3. **Select Slots:**
   - Choose **Source** (e.g., staging) and **Target** (typically production) slots. Verify settings in both tabs:
     - **Source Changes:** Settings that will be applied to the source slot.
     - **Target Changes:** Settings that will be applied to the target slot post-swap.

4. **Immediate Swap:**
   - If you're ready to swap without preview, click **Swap** to execute the operation.

5. **Swap with Preview:**
   - For validation, check the **Perform swap with preview** option. This begins a multi-phase swap:
   
     - **Phase 1:** Applies the target slot's settings to the source slot, then pauses.
     
       ```plaintext
       # Pseudo-code for starting the swap with preview
       start_swap_with_preview(sourceSlot="staging", targetSlot="production")
       ```

     - **Preview:** Visit the source slot URL to test the app with new settings:
     
       ```plaintext
       # URL format for previewing the swap
       https://<app_name>-<source-slot-name>.azurewebsites.net
       ```

     - **Phase 2:** If satisfied with the preview, select **Complete Swap** to finalize the swap.

     ```plaintext
     # Pseudo-code for completing the swap
     complete_swap()
     ```

   - **Cancel:** If issues are found during the preview, select **Cancel Swap** to revert changes.

6. **Close Dialog:**
   - After the swap or cancellation, click **Close** to exit the swap interface.

**Key Points:**

- **Validation:** Always ensure the production slot is the target to minimize downtime.
- **Configuration Review:** Review settings in both slots before proceeding with the swap.
- **Warm-Up:** Swap with preview ensures the source slot is warmed up, reducing the risk of performance issues.
- **Rollback:** If a swap with preview is canceled, the configuration reverts, providing a safety net.

**Conclusion:**

Swapping deployment slots in Azure App Service is like changing the soup of the day in a restaurant's menu - you want to make sure the new flavor (staging environment) is just right before serving it to all the patrons (your production users). With the option to preview, you can taste the soup before making it the special of the day, ensuring it's a hit.

### Configuring Auto Swap in Azure App Service

**Steps to Enable Auto Swap:**

1. **Navigate to the Slot Configuration:**
   - Go to your App Service's resource page in Azure portal.
   - Click on the deployment slot you're configuring for auto swap.

2. **Enable Auto Swap:**
   - Go to **Configuration** > **General settings**.
   - Turn **Auto swap enabled** to **On** and select the **target slot** for auto swap.

     ```plaintext
     # Pseudo-code for enabling auto swap
     enable_auto_swap(sourceSlot="staging", targetSlot="production")
     ```

   - Save the changes.

3. **Code Push:**
   - Push your code to the source slot. Auto swap will occur automatically post-warm-up.

**Custom Warm-Up Configuration:**

- **Using `web.config`:**
  - Insert `<applicationInitialization>` within `<system.webServer>` to specify custom warm-up actions.

    ```xml
    <system.webServer>
        <applicationInitialization>
            <add initializationPage="/" hostName="[app hostname]" />
            <add initializationPage="/Home/About" hostName="[app hostname]" />
        </applicationInitialization>
    </system.webServer>
    ```

- **App Settings for Customization:**

  - **WEBSITE_SWAP_WARMUP_PING_PATH:** Custom URL path to ping for warm-up.

    ```plaintext
    # Setting custom warm-up path
    WEBSITE_SWAP_WARMUP_PING_PATH=/statuscheck
    ```

  - **WEBSITE_SWAP_WARMUP_PING_STATUSES:** HTTP status codes considered valid for warm-up.

    ```plaintext
    # Setting valid HTTP status codes for warm-up
    WEBSITE_SWAP_WARMUP_PING_STATUSES=200,202
    ```

  - **WEBSITE_WARMUP_PATH:** Path to ping on site restarts.

    ```plaintext
    # Setting warm-up path for restarts
    WEBSITE_WARMUP_PATH=/statuscheck
    ```

**Notes:**

- **Linux and Containers:** Auto swap is not supported for web apps on Linux or Web App for Containers.
- **Troubleshooting:** For issues with auto swap or warm-up, refer to deployment slot swap failures documentation.

**Conclusion:**

Configuring auto swap in Azure App Service is like setting up a conveyor belt in a factory. Once your app's code is pushed, it automatically rolls into production, ensuring zero downtime and cold starts. Custom warm-up settings ensure the machinery (your app) is fully operational before it hits the production line, keeping your customers (users) satisfied with smooth service transitions.

### Rollback and Monitoring Slot Swaps in Azure App Service

**Rollback Procedure:**

- **Immediate Swap Back:** If issues arise post-swap:

  ```plaintext
  # Pseudo-code for immediate rollback
  swap_slots(sourceSlot="production", targetSlot="staging")
  ```

  This command effectively swaps the slots back to their original configurations.

**Monitoring the Swap Operation:**

1. **Access the Activity Log:**
   - In the Azure portal, navigate to your app's resource page.
   - From the left pane, select **Activity Log**.

2. **Check Swap Operations:**
   - Look for **Swap Web App Slots** in the activity log entries. This can help you understand:
     - Duration of the swap operation.
     - Any errors or suboperations that occurred.

   ```plaintext
   # Pseudo-code to filter for swap operations in logs
   filter_activity_log(event='Swap Web App Slots')
   ```

3. **Detail Examination:**
   - Click on the swap event to expand it, where you can:
     - Review suboperations.
     - Access error details if the swap didn't complete as expected.

**Conclusion:**

Rollback in Azure App Service is like hitting an "undo" button for your environment swap. If the new production setup doesn't perform as expected, a quick re-swap can bring back the previous version while you investigate. Monitoring through the activity log is akin to reviewing the flight recorder after a flight; it helps you understand what happened during the swap journey, ensuring you can troubleshoot or optimize future swaps.

### Routing Traffic in Azure App Service

**Traffic Routing Overview:**

- By default, all traffic goes to the production slot. However, Azure allows you to route traffic to different slots for testing or phased rollouts.

**Steps for Automatic Traffic Routing:**

1. **Navigate to Deployment Slots:**
   - Go to your app's **Deployment slots** section in the Azure portal.

2. **Set Traffic Percentage:**
   - In the **Traffic %** column for the desired slot (e.g., staging):
     - Enter a percentage (0-100) of traffic to be routed to this slot.
     - Click **Save**.

     ```plaintext
     # Pseudo-code for setting traffic distribution
     set_traffic_percentage(slotName="staging", percentage=10)
     ```

3. **Client Routing:**
   - After saving, the specified percentage of traffic will be randomly routed to the slot.
   - Clients are **pinned** to the slot for their session duration, determined by the `x-ms-routing-name` cookie.

**Example of Traffic Distribution:**

- If you set **staging** to receive 10% of the traffic:
  - 10% of users will be directed to the staging environment.
  - They will receive this cookie: `x-ms-routing-name=staging`
  - The remaining 90% will go to production with `x-ms-routing-name=self`.

**Checking Slot Assignment:**

- Use the `x-ms-routing-name` cookie from HTTP headers to confirm which slot your session is using.

**Conclusion:**

Routing traffic in Azure App Service is like directing a small portion of your audience to a different theater for a sneak preview. You get real user feedback without committing the entire audience. By controlling the traffic percentage, you can test updates safely, and the sticky session ensures users stay with their assigned slot throughout their visit, providing a consistent experience for testing purposes.

### Manual Traffic Routing in Azure App Service

**Manual Traffic Routing with Query Parameters:**

- Azure App Service allows routing traffic manually to different slots using the `x-ms-routing-name` query parameter.

**Opting Out of Beta:**

- To return users to the production environment from a beta or testing slot:

```html
<a href="<webappname>.azurewebsites.net/?x-ms-routing-name=self">Go back to production app</a>
```

- This link sets the `x-ms-routing-name` to **self**, directing the user to the production slot. Subsequent requests include this cookie, keeping the user in production for the session.

**Opting Into Beta:**

- To direct users to a non-production slot (like staging):

```html
<webappname>.azurewebsites.net/?x-ms-routing-name=staging
```

- Replace `staging` with your slot's name.

**Advanced Traffic Control:**

- When setting a slot's traffic percentage to **0%**:
  - The **0%** value in black indicates that the slot is not automatically routing traffic, but manual access via the query parameter is still possible.
  - This setup is useful for hiding the slot from public traffic while allowing specific users or internal teams to access it for testing.

**Key Points:**

- **Manual Routing:** Useful for beta testing where users can opt in or out.
- **Cookie Persistence:** Once a user is routed, the session is "pinned" to that slot via a cookie.
- **Slot Visibility:** Setting traffic to 0% hides the slot from random routing but allows manual access.

**Conclusion:**

Manual traffic routing with Azure App Service is like having a secret handshake. You can give users the option to see behind the curtain (beta environment) or return to the main stage (production) without interrupting the overall show. It's a clever way to get targeted feedback or to conduct controlled testing without throwing open the doors to everyone.

**AZ-204: Implement Azure Functions**

**Content:**
- **Introduction to Azure Functions:**
  - Azure Functions are serverless compute services for running small pieces of code, or "functions," in the cloud.
  - They're great for scenarios where you need to execute code in response to events without managing infrastructure.

- **Creating and Deploying Functions:**
  - **Steps to Create a Function:** 
    ```plaintext
    - Choose runtime (e.g., .NET, Node.js, Python)
    - Select a hosting plan
    - Write or upload your function code
    - Configure triggers and bindings
    ```
  - **Deployment Options:**
    - Direct publish from Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code
    - Azure DevOps for CI/CD
    - Azure Portal for quick testing and deployment

- **Hosting Options:**
  - **Consumption plan:** Pay only for compute resources when your functions are running.
  - **Premium plan:** Dedicated resources, better performance, and VNET support.
  - **App Service plan:** If you already have apps running on Azure App Service.

- **Triggers and Bindings:**
  - **Triggers:** Events that cause your function to run (e.g., HTTP requests, timers, queues).
  - **Bindings:** Simplify integration with services by defining how data is input or output (e.g., blob storage, Cosmos DB).

**Prerequisites:**
- **Experience:** At least one year developing scalable solutions.
- **Azure Knowledge:** Basic understanding of Azure services and portal navigation.
- **Recommendation:** If new to Azure, complete AZ-900: Azure Fundamentals first.

**Tips for Learning:**
- Hands-on labs in the Azure portal can give you practical experience.
- Use Azure Functions Core Tools for local development and debugging.
- Consider scenarios where serverless would benefit your applications, like real-time data processing or IoT data handling.

Remember, Azure Functions are like the Swiss Army Knife of cloud services; versatile, handy, and they might just save the day when you're in a bind. Happy coding!

**Introduction to Azure Functions**:

**Key Concepts:**

- **Azure Functions:** 
  - Azure Functions enable you to build serverless applications. Essentially, you're writing small pieces of code (functions) that execute in the cloud in response to various events without needing to manage server infrastructure.

**Learning Outcomes:**
- **Comparison with Other Azure Services:**
  - **Azure Functions** vs **Azure Logic Apps** vs **WebJobs:**
    - **Azure Functions:** Best for event-driven, scalable compute scenarios. You write the code in response to triggers.
    - **Azure Logic Apps:** Workflow automation service, visual designer for SaaS and enterprise integration.
    - **WebJobs:** Runs background tasks within an App Service web app, but less scalable in terms of execution frequency and event types.

- **Hosting Options in Azure Functions:**
  - **Consumption Plan:** Ideal for scenarios where you need to run code sporadically. You're charged based on resource consumption.
  - **Premium Plan:** Provides pre-warmed instances, longer execution time, and VNET integration for better performance and security.
  - **Dedicated (App Service) Plan:** Best if you're already using Azure App Service for other applications, allows for constant warm-up.

- **Scalability:**
  - Azure Functions automatically scale based on the number of incoming events or triggers, up to the limits of your hosting plan. This means your application can handle load spikes without manual intervention.

**Practical Considerations:**
- Choose Azure Functions when:
  - You need to run code in response to specific events (like HTTP requests, timer triggers, etc.)
  - You want to pay only for the compute resources you consume.
  - Your workload is highly variable or unpredictable.

- **Example Use Case:**
  ```plaintext
  // A basic Azure Function that responds to an HTTP GET request
  [FunctionName("GetUserProfile")]
  public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(
      [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", Route = "user/{userId}")] HttpRequest req,
      string userId,
      ILogger log)
  {
      log.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");
      
      // Your code to fetch user profile goes here
      var profile = await FetchUserProfileAsync(userId);
      
      return new OkObjectResult(profile);
  }
  ```

Remember, with Azure Functions, you're not just coding; you're thinking like a cloud-native developer, letting the cloud take care of the "server" part so you can focus on the "less" part.

**Discover Azure Functions**:

**Module Overview:**
- **Status:** Completed
- **XP:** 100
- **Duration:** 3 minutes

**Key Points:**

- **Serverless Architecture:** 
  - Azure Functions embodies the serverless computing model where you focus on writing code for business logic while Azure handles the infrastructure.

- **Use Cases for Azure Functions:**
  - **Web APIs:** Serve as endpoints for APIs that can scale automatically.
  - **Database Change Response:** Trigger functions when data changes occur.
  - **IoT Data Processing:** Handle streams of data from IoT devices.
  - **Message Queue Management:** Process messages from queues like Azure Service Bus.

- **Core Components:**

  - **Triggers:** 
    - Trigger types include:
      - HTTP trigger (REST APIs)
      - Timer trigger (scheduled tasks)
      - Queue trigger (message processing from Azure Queue Storage)
      - Blob storage trigger (file uploads)

    ```plaintext
    // Example of an HTTP trigger
    [FunctionName("HttpExample")]
    public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(
        [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", "post", Route = null)] HttpRequest req,
        ILogger log)
    {
        log.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");

        string name = req.Query["name"];

        string requestBody = await new StreamReader(req.Body).ReadToEndAsync();
        dynamic data = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(requestBody);
        name = name ?? data?.name;

        return name != null
            ? (ActionResult)new OkObjectResult($"Hello, {name}")
            : new BadRequestObjectResult("Please pass a name on the query string or in the request body");
    }
    ```

  - **Bindings:**
    - Simplify coding by automatically connecting to input or output data sources.
    - Examples include:
      - **Input Binding:** Fetch data from a blob storage when the function runs.
      - **Output Binding:** Send results to a database or queue after processing.

    ```plaintext
    // Example of an output binding to send a message to a queue
    [FunctionName("QueueOutputExample")]
    public static void Run(
        [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", "post", Route = null)] HttpRequest req,
        [Queue("outqueue"), StorageAccount("AzureWebJobsStorage")] out string myQueueItem,
        ILogger log)
    {
        log.LogInformation("C# HTTP trigger function processed a request.");

        string name = req.Query["name"];
        string requestBody = new StreamReader(req.Body).ReadToEnd();
        dynamic data = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject(requestBody);
        name = name ?? data?.name;

        myQueueItem = $"New Queue Item: {name}";
    }
    ```

- **Automation and Integration:**
  - Azure Functions can be part of a larger ecosystem of integration tools in Azure, working alongside Azure Logic Apps, Azure Event Grid, and Azure Service Bus to automate processes and integrate systems.

Remember, Azure Functions are your ticket to a world where you don't need to manage servers - just the logic that matters. It's like having a team of invisible IT staff that you never have to meet!

Comparing **Azure Functions** and **Azure Logic Apps** as well as a comparison with **WebJobs**:

**Azure Functions vs Azure Logic Apps:**

- **Development Approach:**
  - **Azure Functions:** Code-first (imperative)
    - You write the code for each step of the orchestration.
    - Durable Functions can be used for stateful workflows:
      ```plaintext
      // Example of a Durable Function in Azure Functions
      [FunctionName("OrchestratorFunction")]
      public static async Task Run(
          [OrchestrationTrigger] IDurableOrchestrationContext context)
      {
          await context.CallActivityAsync("Activity1", "Hello");
          await context.CallActivityAsync("Activity2", "World");
      }
      ```
  - **Logic Apps:** Designer-first (declarative)
    - Use a visual designer or edit configuration files.

- **Connectivity:**
  - **Azure Functions:** Limited built-in bindings, but you can code for custom ones.
  - **Logic Apps:** Extensive library of connectors including Enterprise Integration Pack.

- **Actions:**
  - **Azure Functions:** Each action is a function you must code.
  - **Logic Apps:** Predefined actions which can be configured without coding.

- **Monitoring:**
  - **Azure Functions:** Uses Azure Application Insights.
  - **Logic Apps:** Monitored via the Azure portal and Azure Monitor logs.

- **Management:**
  - **Azure Functions:** REST API, Visual Studio.
  - **Logic Apps:** Azure portal, REST API, PowerShell, Visual Studio.

- **Execution Context:**
  - Both can run in Azure, but Logic Apps can also run locally or on-premises.

**Azure Functions vs WebJobs with WebJobs SDK:**

- **Serverless and Scaling:**
  - **Azure Functions:** True serverless with automatic scaling.
  - **WebJobs:** Not serverless in nature, does not scale automatically.

- **Development Environment:**
  - **Azure Functions:** Can develop and test in the browser.
  - **WebJobs:** Requires Visual Studio or similar IDE for development.

- **Pricing:**
  - **Azure Functions:** Pay-per-use, more cost-effective for intermittent workloads.
  - **WebJobs:** Part of the App Service plan, which might not be as cost-effective for sporadic workloads.

- **Integration with Logic Apps:**
  - **Azure Functions:** Can be used as actions within Logic Apps workflows.
  - **WebJobs:** Not directly integrated with Logic Apps.

- **Trigger Events:**
  - Both support a variety of triggers, but Azure Functions offers more flexibility and includes newer Azure services like Event Grid.

**Conclusion:**
- **Azure Functions** is generally the recommended service for new projects due to:

    return name != null
        ? (ActionResult)new OkObjectResult($"Hello, {name}")
        : new BadRequestObjectResult("Please pass a name on the query string or in the request body");
}
```

Remember, choosing the right plan is like picking the right spaceship for your interstellar journey - you need to consider the load you're carrying, the conditions you'll face, and how much fuel you're willing to spend!

**Dedicated Plan** and **Container Apps** along with the **Function App Timeout Duration**:

**Dedicated Plan:**
- **Hosting:** Functions run within an App Service plan.
- **Billing:** Regular App Service plan rates.
- **Use Cases:**
  - **Predictable Billing:** When you need a consistent billing model.
  - **Manual Scaling:** For scenarios where you want to manually control scaling.
  - **Resource Sharing:** If you're running multiple web and function apps on the same plan.
  - **Large Compute:** Access to larger compute sizes.
  - **Isolation:** When you need full compute isolation and secure network access via an App Service Environment (ASE).
  - **High Memory/Scale:** Suited for applications with high memory usage or those requiring high scale.

**Container Apps:**
- **Hosting:** Fully managed environment for containerized function apps.
- **Benefits:**
  - **Simplified Operations:** Avoid managing Kubernetes clusters.
  - **Microservices:** Functions can run alongside other cloud-native services.
  - **Custom Libraries:** Package custom libraries with your function code.
  - **Legacy Migration:** Migrate from on-premises or legacy to cloud-native containerized workloads.
  - **Dedicated CPU:** When high-end CPU resources are needed for function execution.

**Function App Timeout Duration:**
- **host.json Configuration:** The `functionTimeout` property sets the execution timeout for functions.
- **Behavior:**
  - Functions must respond within the timeout duration after being triggered.

**Timeout Values by Plan:**

| Plan                 | Default (minutes) | Maximum (minutes)       |
|----------------------|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Consumption Plan     | 5                 | 10                      |
| Flex Consumption Plan | 30                | Unlimited               |
| Premium Plan         | 30                | Unlimited               |
| Dedicated Plan       | 30                | Unlimited               |
| Container Apps       | 30                | Unlimited               |

- **HTTP Trigger Limit:** Even if the function app timeout is set to unlimited, HTTP-triggered functions have a hard limit of 230 seconds to respond.
- **Version 1.x Default:** No timeout limit for version 1.x of the Functions runtime.
- **Guaranteed Execution:** Up to 60 minutes for Premium, Dedicated, and Container Apps, with caveats for OS updates, patching, or scale-in.
- **Flex Consumption Caveat:** No enforced limit, but termination can occur due to platform actions.
- **Container Apps with Zero Replicas:** Default timeout varies based on triggers when minimum replicas are set to zero.

When configuring your function app, remember that setting these timeouts is like setting the timer on your space suit's air supply - too short and you might run into issues mid-task, too long and you might end up paying for air you don't use. Balance is key!

**Scale Azure Functions**:

**Scaling Behaviors by Hosting Plan:**

| **Plan**               | **Scale Out Behavior**                                                                 | **Max # Instances**               |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| **Consumption Plan**   | - Event-driven scaling<br>- Automatically scales out during high load.<br>- Scales based on incoming trigger events. | - **Windows:** 200<br>- **Linux:** 100[^1] |
| **Flex Consumption Plan** | - Per-function scaling<br>- Deterministic scaling based on individual function triggers.<br>- Scales by adding instances for each function. | - Limited by total memory usage across a region. |
| **Premium Plan**       | - Event-driven<br>- Automatically scales based on function triggers.                     | - **Windows:** 100<br>- **Linux:** 20-100[^2] |
| **Dedicated Plan**     | - Manual or Autoscale<br>- Scaling is controlled by user-defined rules or manually.      | - **Standard:** 10-30<br>- **ASE:** 100       |
| **Container Apps**     | - Event-driven<br>- Automatically scales by adding more instances based on event triggers. | - **Range:** 10-300[^4]           |

**Notes:**

- **Consumption Plan:** 
  - During scale-out, there's a limit of 500 instances per subscription per hour for Linux apps.
  
- **Premium Plan:**
  - The ability to scale to 100 instances for Linux apps is region-dependent.

- **Dedicated Plan:**
  - Specific limits depend on the App Service plan options. For more details, refer to App Service plan limits.

- **Container Apps:**
  - You can configure the maximum number of replicas, which is respected provided there are enough cores available in the quota.

**Example Code for Scaling Configuration in `host.json` (if applicable):**

```json
{
  "version": "2.0",
  "extensions": {
    "http": {
      "routePrefix": "api",
      "maxOutstandingRequests": 200, // Example configuration for HTTP triggers
      "maxConcurrentRequests": 35
    }
  },
  "functionTimeout": "00:05:00", // Example timeout setting
  "healthMonitor": {
    "enabled": true,
    "healthCheckInterval": "00:00:10",
    "healthCheckWindow": "00:02:00",
    "healthCheckThreshold": 6,
    "counterThreshold": 0.80
  }
}
```

This configuration snippet shows how you might set up scaling-related parameters in Azure Functions, focusing on HTTP triggers and health monitoring.

Remember, scaling in Azure Functions is like managing a fleet of interstellar vessels; you want each ship (instance) to be ready to handle the load, and sometimes you need to call in reinforcements or send some ships home when the job's done!

Remember, while developing Azure Functions, you're not just coding; you're orchestrating a symphony of cloud events. Keep your functions light, your dependencies lean, and your code clean!

**Introduction to Developing Azure Functions**:

**Key Concepts of Azure Functions:**

1. **Function App:**
   - A function app is the container for your functions in Azure. It defines the execution context for a set of functions, including runtime settings.

2. **Function:**
   - A function is the unit of work, the actual piece of code that runs when triggered. Functions can be stateless or stateful (using Durable Functions for orchestration).

3. **Trigger:**
   - A trigger defines how a function is invoked. Each function must have exactly one trigger.
   - Common triggers include:
     - **HTTP**: Invoked via HTTP requests.
     - **Timer**: Scheduled execution.
     - **Blob Storage**: Triggered when files are uploaded or changed.

4. **Bindings:**
   - Bindings are how functions connect to and interact with data sources, services, and other resources.
   - There are **Input** bindings (like reading from a queue) and **Output** bindings (like writing to a database).
   - Examples:
     - **Input Binding:** Automatically fetch data from Cosmos DB when the function runs.
     - **Output Binding:** Send a message to a Service Bus queue after processing.

5. **Function.json:**
   - Configuration file for each function, defining triggers, bindings, and other settings.

**Learning Outcomes:**

- **Explain the Key Components:**
  - Understanding how function apps, functions, triggers, and bindings work together.

- **Create Triggers and Bindings:**
  - You'll learn how to set up triggers to define when functions run, and bindings to handle input and output data.

- **Connect to Azure Services:**
  - Functions can integrate seamlessly with other Azure services for both triggers and bindings.

- **Create Functions Using Visual Studio Code & Azure Functions Core Tools:**
  - Visual Studio Code is a lightweight, powerful tool for developing Azure Functions.
  - **Azure Functions Core Tools** allows for local debugging, testing, and deployment.

**Practical Example:**

```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "authLevel": "function",
      "type": "httpTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "name": "req",
      "methods": [
        "get",
        "post"
      ]
    },
    {
      "type": "http",
      "direction": "out",
      "name": "res"
    }
  ],
  "scriptFile": "../dist/FunctionApp/index.js"
}
```

This `function.json` configuration describes an HTTP trigger function. It awaits HTTP GET or POST requests and responds via an HTTP output binding.

**Note:**
When developing, remember that Azure Functions are like the Swiss Army Knife of Azure services; they can slice through data, connect disparate services, and scale like a pro, all without you worrying about the infrastructure.

**Explore Azure Functions Development**:

**Function App:**

- **Definition:** A function app is the deployment and management unit in Azure for your functions.
- **Composition:** It contains one or more functions that are managed, deployed, and scaled as a group.
- **Shared Resources:** Functions within an app share:
  - The same pricing plan
  - Deployment method
  - Runtime version
- **Version Consideration:**
  - **Functions 2.x:** All functions within a function app must use the same programming language.
  - **Previous Versions:** Did not require all functions to be in the same language.

**Local Development:**

- **Advantages:**
  - Use your preferred code editor and development tools.
  - Easily test and debug functions on your local machine using the full Functions runtime.
  - Connect to live Azure services for testing purposes.

- **Development Environments:**
  - Choice depends on your language and tool preferences:
    - **Visual Studio:** For .NET developers.
    - **Visual Studio Code:** Cross-platform and supports various languages.
    - **Azure Functions Core Tools:** Command-line interface for all languages, good for automation and CI/CD.

- **Important Note:**
  - Due to portal limitations, local development is recommended. Editing function code in the Azure portal has limitations, so:
    - Develop functions locally.
    - Publish them to a function app in Azure.

**Local Development Configuration:**

```json
// local.settings.json
{
  "IsEncrypted": false,
  "Values": {
    "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
    "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet"
  }
}
```

- The `local.settings.json` file contains settings used during local development. The `AzureWebJobsStorage` setting here uses the local Azure Storage Emulator, and `FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME` specifies the runtime environment.

**Guideline for Local Development:**
- Use local development for building and testing your functions.
- Ensure your local setup mirrors the Azure environment as closely as possible to avoid discrepancies post-deployment.
- Leverage local debugging tools for efficient troubleshooting before pushing to Azure.

Remember, with Azure Functions, you're not just writing code; you're crafting small, powerful pieces of cloud-native logic that can be tested at home and then sent out into the cosmos of Azure to do their job.

**Local Project Files** in Azure Functions:

**Essential Local Project Files:**

- **host.json:**
  - **Purpose:** This file contains global configuration options for all functions within a function app instance.
  - **Environment:** 
    - **Azure:** Configuration is managed via application settings.
    - **Local:** Configuration is managed in the `local.settings.json` file.
  - **Bindings:** Configuration for bindings in `host.json` applies to all functions in the app.

- **local.settings.json:**
  - **Purpose:** Stores app settings and local development tools settings.
  - **Usage:** Only used when running the project locally.
  - **Security Consideration:**
    ```json
    {
      "IsEncrypted": false,
      "Values": {
        "AzureWebJobsStorage": "UseDevelopmentStorage=true",
        "FUNCTIONS_WORKER_RUNTIME": "dotnet",
        "MySecretSetting": "secretValue"
      },
      "ConnectionStrings": {
        "SQLDBConnectionString": "Server=tcp:yourserver.database.windows.net,1433;Initial Catalog=yourdatabase;Persist Security Info=False;User ID=youruserid;Password=yourpassword;MultipleActiveResultSets=False;Encrypt=True;TrustServerCertificate=False;Connection Timeout=30;"
      }
    }
    ```
    - **Note:** Secrets like connection strings should be kept out of source control. Consider encrypting this file or using a secrets management system.
  
**Synchronizing Settings:**

- **Local to Azure:** After local development, ensure that all necessary settings are replicated in your Azure function app's application settings before deployment.
- **Azure to Local:** You can download your Azure function app's current settings to synchronize with your local development environment.

**Best Practices:**

- **Never commit `local.settings.json`:** This file can contain sensitive information. Use `.gitignore` or similar to exclude it from version control.
- **Use Environment Variables:** In Azure, use app settings for configuration which can be accessed as environment variables.
- **Secrets Management:** Consider using Azure Key Vault or another secrets management service for handling sensitive information.

Developers should treat local settings files with care, recognizing that while they're vital for local development, they pose a security risk if accidentally shared or committed to source control.

**Create Triggers and Bindings**:

**Triggers and Bindings:**

- **Trigger:**
  - **Defines:** How a function is invoked.
  - **Requirement:** Must have exactly one per function.
  - **Data:** Associated data provided as the payload.

- **Bindings:**
  - **Purpose:** Declaratively connect to resources for input or output.
  - **Types:** 
    - **Input:** Data provided as function parameters.
    - **Output:** Data sent via function return value or out parameters.
  - **Flexibility:** Can have multiple bindings or none at all.
  - **Benefits:** 
    - Reduces hardcoding service access.
    - Simplifies integration with other Azure services.

**Configuring Triggers and Bindings:**

- **C# Class Library:**
  - Use **C# attributes** to decorate methods and parameters.

```csharp
// Example of HTTP Trigger in C#
public static class Function1
{
    [FunctionName("HttpTriggerCSharp")]
    public static async Task<IActionResult> Run(
        [HttpTrigger(AuthorizationLevel.Function, "get", "post", Route = null)] HttpRequest req,
        ILogger log)
    {
        // Function logic here
    }
}
```

- **Java:**
  - Use **Java annotations** for configuration.

```java
// Example of Queue Trigger in Java
@FunctionName("QueueTriggerJava")
public void run(
    @QueueTrigger(name = "message", queueName = "myqueue-items", connection = "AzureWebJobsStorage") String message,
    final ExecutionContext context
) {
    context.getLogger().info("Java Queue trigger function processed a message: " + message);
}
```

- **JavaScript/PowerShell/Python/TypeScript:**
  - **function.json** schema is updated.

```json
{
    "bindings": [
        {
            "name": "req",
            "type": "httpTrigger",
            "direction": "in",
            "dataType": "binary",
            "methods": ["get", "post"]
        },
        {
            "name": "response",
            "type": "http",
            "direction": "out"
        }
    ]
}
```

- **Portal Configuration:**
  - For dynamically typed languages, set `dataType` in `function.json` to handle different data formats (e.g., `binary`, `stream`, `string`).

**Binding Direction:**

- **Triggers:** Always `in`.
- **Bindings:** 
  - `in` for input.
  - `out` for output.
  - `inout` for special bidirectional bindings, limited to Advanced editor in the Azure portal.

**C# and Java Notes:**

- **Parameter Type:** Defines the data type for input in strongly typed languages.
- **Portal Limitations:** Functions defined with attributes can't be edited in the portal as they don't use `function.json`.

Remember, configuring triggers and bindings is like setting up the plumbing for your function; you're telling Azure how to funnel data in and out, ensuring your function can do its job without drowning in boilerplate code.

**Azure Functions Trigger and Binding Example**:

**Scenario Description:**
- Trigger a function when a new message appears in Azure Queue storage.
- Write the message content as a new row to Azure Table storage.

**function.json Configuration:**

```json
{
  "disabled": false,
  "bindings": [
    {
      "type": "queueTrigger",
      "direction": "in",
      "name": "myQueueItem",
      "queueName": "myqueue-items",
      "connection": "MyStorageConnectionAppSetting"
    },
    {
      "tableName": "Person",
      "connection": "MyStorageConnectionAppSetting",
      "name": "tableBinding",
      "type": "table",
      "direction": "out"
    }
  ]
}
```

- **Queue Trigger Binding:**
  - **Type:** `queueTrigger`
  - **Direction:** `in` (input)
  - **Name:** `myQueueItem` (function parameter)
  - **QueueName:** `myqueue-items` (name of the queue to monitor)
  - **Connection:** Points to an app setting for the storage account connection string.

- **Table Output Binding:**
  - **Type:** `table`
  - **Direction:** `out` (output)
  - **Name:** `tableBinding` (used to identify the output)
  - **TableName:** `Person` (the table where data will be stored)
  - **Connection:** Points to the same app setting as the trigger for storage account access.

**C# Function Example:**

```csharp
public static class QueueTriggerTableOutput
{
    [FunctionName("QueueTriggerTableOutput")]
    [return: Table("outTable", Connection = "MY_TABLE_STORAGE_ACCT_APP_SETTING")]
    public static Person Run(
        [QueueTrigger("myqueue-items", Connection = "MY_STORAGE_ACCT_APP_SETTING")] JObject order,
        ILogger log)
    {
        return new Person() {
            PartitionKey = "Orders",
            RowKey = Guid.NewGuid().ToString(),
            Name = order["Name"].ToString(),
            MobileNumber = order["MobileNumber"].ToString() 
        };
    }
}

public class Person
{
    public string PartitionKey { get; set; }
    public string RowKey { get; set; }
    public string Name { get; set; }
    public string MobileNumber { get; set; }
}
```

- **FunctionName:** Names the function for easy reference and deployment.
- **QueueTrigger Attribute:** Specifies the queue name and connection string app setting for the trigger.
- **Table Attribute:** On the return value, specifies the output table and its connection setting.
- **Person Class:** Represents the data structure for the table entry.

**Key Points:**

- The `QueueTrigger` attribute on the `order` parameter indicates that the function runs when a new message is added to the queue.
- The function processes the queue message data and constructs a `Person` object.
- The return of the `Person` object is bound to the Table Storage output, automatically inserting this data as a new row in the 'outTable'.

This setup demonstrates how Azure Functions can automate data processing workflows with minimal code, leveraging triggers and bindings to interact with Azure services.

**Connect Functions to Azure Services**:

**Secure Connection Practices:**

- **Application Settings:**
  - Use Azure App Service's application settings to store sensitive information like connection strings.
  - These settings are encrypted and treated as environment variables at runtime.
  - For bindings, reference these settings rather than hardcoding the actual connection details.

**Using Environment Variables:**

- **Local Development:** Use `local.settings.json` for local environment variables.
- **Azure Deployment:** Use Azure Application Settings for production environment variables.

**Identity-Based Connections:**

- **Managed Identity:** Preferred over secrets where supported.
  - **Default:** Uses system-assigned managed identity.
  - **User-Assigned:** Available with `credential` and `clientID` properties.
  - **Limitation:** Can't configure using resource ID for user-assigned identities.
- **Local Development:** Uses the developer's identity by default, which can be customized.

**Example of configuring managed identity for Azure Key Vault:**

```json
{
  "bindings": [
    {
      "type": "keyVault",
      "direction": "in",
      "name": "mySecret",
      "keyVaultName": "mykeyvault",
      "secretName": "MySecret",
      "credential": "ManagedIdentity"
    }
  ]
}
```

**Permissions Management:**

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**
  - Assign necessary roles to the managed identity via Azure RBAC.
  - Roles should match the minimum requirements for the function's operations.

- **Access Policies:**
  - For services like Azure Key Vault, specify the identity in an access policy.

```plaintext
# Example of granting permissions via Azure CLI
az role assignment create --assignee <managed-identity-principal-id> --role <role-name> --scope /subscriptions/<subscription-id>/resourceGroups/<resource-group>/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/<storage-account-name>
```

**Important Considerations:**

- **Azure Files Limitation:** 
  - In Consumption or Elastic Premium plans, storage account access for Azure Files uses predefined connection settings, which do not support managed identity.

- **Least Privilege Principle:**
  - Grant only the permissions required for the function to operate, avoiding over-provisioning access rights.

When setting up connections, think of it like giving out keys to your interstellar spaceship. You wouldn't give every crew member the key to the command deck; you'd only give them access to their specific stations. Similarly, in Azure Functions, manage identities and permissions with care to keep your cloud operations secure and efficient.

- **Premium:** Offers higher performance using SSDs, with three specific types:

  | **Type of storage account** | **Supported storage services** | **Redundancy options** | **Usage** |
  |-----------------------------|-------------------------------|------------------------|-----------|
  | **Standard general-purpose v2** | Blob, Queue, Table, Azure Files | LRS, GRS, RA-GRS, ZRS, GZRS, RA-GZRS | Default for most scenarios. Supports NFS in Azure Files with premium type. |
  | **Premium block blobs** | Blob Storage | LRS, ZRS | For high transaction rates, smaller objects, or low latency. |
  | **Premium file shares** | Azure Files | LRS, ZRS | For enterprise or high-performance file share applications. |
  | **Premium page blobs** | Page blobs | LRS, ZRS | Exclusively for page blobs. |

### **Access Tiers for Block Blob Data**

**Azure Storage provides different access tiers for efficient cost management:**

- **Hot Access Tier:** 
  - Optimized for frequent access.
  - Highest storage cost, lowest access cost.
  - Default tier for new accounts.

- **Cool Access Tier:** 
  - For data accessed infrequently, stored for at least 30 days.
  - Lower storage costs, higher access costs than Hot.

- **Cold Access Tier:** 
  - For data accessed even less frequently, stored for at least 90 days.
  - Lower storage costs than Cool, higher access costs.

- **Archive Tier:** 
  - For data with retrieval latency of several hours, stored for at least 180 days.
  - Most cost-effective for storage, but expensive for retrieval compared to others.

**Code Example for Changing Blob's Access Tier in .NET:**
```csharp
BlobClient blobClient = new BlobClient(connectionString, containerName, blobName);
await blobClient.SetAccessTierAsync(AccessTier.Hot);
Console.WriteLine("Blob access tier changed to Hot.");
```

**Note:** 
- Transitioning between tiers can be done at any time based on data usage changes.
- Consider the cost implications when moving data between tiers, especially to and from the Archive tier.

**Code Example for Client-Side Encryption (Conceptual):**
```csharp
// This is a conceptual example, real implementations will vary based on the language and library used.
BlobServiceClient blobServiceClient = new BlobServiceClient(connectionString);

// Create or get a client-side encryption key
// var encryptionKey = ... // Key generation or retrieval would go here

// Create a BlobClient with client-side encryption
BlobClient encryptedBlobClient = blobServiceClient.GetBlobClient(containerName, blobName)
    .WithClientSideEncryptionOptions(new ClientSideEncryptionOptions(encryptionKey));

// Upload a file with encryption
using (var fileStream = File.OpenRead(localFilePath))
{
    await encryptedBlobClient.UploadAsync(fileStream, true);
}

// Download and decrypt the blob
var blobContent = await encryptedBlobClient.DownloadAsync();
using (var memoryStream = new MemoryStream())
{
    await blobContent.Value.Content.CopyToAsync(memoryStream);
    // memoryStream now contains the decrypted blob content
}
```

**Manage the Azure Blob Storage Lifecycle**

#### **Objective:**
To understand and implement lifecycle management strategies for data in Azure Blob Storage, ensuring data availability and cost efficiency.

#### **Key Concepts:**

1. **Lifecycle Management:**
   - **Purpose:** Automate actions like transitioning data to cooler access tiers or deleting it after a set period to optimize costs and manage storage efficiently.

2. **Lifecycle Policies:**
   - Policies can be set to:
     - **Transition:** Move data from hot to cool, cold, or archive tiers based on access patterns or time since last modification.
     - **Delete:** Automatically remove blobs that are no longer needed.

3. **Example of a Lifecycle Policy in JSON:**

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "name": "transitionToCoolRule",
      "enabled": true,
      "type": "Lifecycle",
      "definition": {
        "actions": {
          "baseBlob": {
            "tierToCool": {
              "daysAfterModificationGreaterThan": 30
            }
          }
        },
        "filters": {
          "blobTypes": ["blockBlob"],
          "prefixMatch": ["container1/prefix1"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "deleteOldBlobsRule",
      "enabled": true,
      "type": "Lifecycle",
      "definition": {
        "actions": {
          "baseBlob": {
            "delete": {
              "daysAfterModificationGreaterThan": 365
            }
          }
        },
        "filters": {
          "blobTypes": ["blockBlob"],
          "prefixMatch": ["container2/prefix2"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

   - **Explanation:**
     - The first rule transitions blobs to the cool tier 30 days after last modification.
     - The second rule deletes blobs after they are 365 days old.

4. **Implementation Steps:**
   - **Create/Edit Policy:** Use Azure Portal, Azure CLI, Azure PowerShell, or REST API to set up lifecycle management policies.
   - **Review:** Regularly check and adjust policies based on data usage patterns and business requirements.

5. **Benefits:**
   - **Cost Management:** Reduces storage costs by placing data on appropriate access tiers.
   - **Data Governance:** Automates compliance with data retention policies.

#### **Remaining Units:**
- Likely will cover more detailed scenarios, policy creation, monitoring, and advanced configurations.

---

These notes outline the basics for managing the lifecycle of data in Azure Blob Storage, providing a foundation for understanding how to automate data management tasks for efficiency and cost optimization.

---

### **Introduction to Azure Blob Storage Lifecycle Management**

#### **Overview:**
Data in Azure Blob Storage goes through different lifecycle stages where its access frequency varies:

- **Initial Stage:** Data is frequently accessed.
- **Aging Stage:** Access drops significantly.
- **Idle Stage:** Data becomes rarely accessed or completely idle.

#### **Learning Objectives:**
Upon completing this module, you will:

1. **Understand Access Tiers:**
   - **Hot Tier:** Optimized for frequent access, with the highest storage cost but lowest access cost.
   - **Cool Tier:** For data accessed infrequently, offering lower storage costs but higher access costs compared to the Hot tier.
   - **Cold Tier:** For data that's accessed even less often, with even lower storage costs.
   - **Archive Tier:** For data that might not be accessed for a long time, with the lowest storage cost but highest retrieval cost.

2. **Create and Implement Lifecycle Policies:**
   - **Purpose:** Automate the transition of data through different access tiers or deletion based on time or other criteria.
   - **Example Policy Creation (Conceptual):**

     ```json
     {
       "rules": [
         {
           "name": "transitionToCoolTier",
           "enabled": true,
           "type": "Lifecycle",
           "definition": {
             "actions": {
               "baseBlob": {
                 "tierToCool": { "daysAfterModificationGreaterThan": 30 }
               }
             },
             "filters": {
               "blobTypes": ["blockBlob"],
               "prefixMatch": ["mycontainer/logs/"]
             }
           }
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

     - This policy moves blobs in `mycontainer/logs/` to the Cool tier 30 days after modification.

3. **Rehydrate Blob Data from Archive:**
   - **Process:** Moving data from the Archive tier to a more accessible tier like Hot or Cool for retrieval.
   - **Note:** Rehydration involves a waiting period due to the nature of the Archive tier.

#### **Key Takeaways:**
- Data lifecycle management in Azure Blob Storage helps in optimizing costs and managing data efficiently.
- Policies can be set up to automatically handle data transitions or deletions.
- Rehydration is necessary when needing to access archived data but comes with delays and costs.

---

These notes encapsulate the essentials of managing data lifecycle in Azure Blob Storage, focusing on understanding access tiers, implementing lifecycle policies, and the process of data rehydration from the archive tier.

---

### **Explore the Azure Blob Storage Lifecycle**

#### **Overview:**
Data in Azure Blob Storage has varying lifecycle patterns:

- **Frequent Access:** Initially, data might be accessed often.
- **Infrequent Access:** Access decreases as data ages.
- **Long-term Storage:** Some data remains idle or archived with very low access frequency.
- **Expiration:** Some data has a short lifespan, expiring quickly after creation.
- **Active Use:** Other datasets are actively used throughout their existence.

#### **Access Tiers:**
Azure provides tiered storage options to match different data access patterns:

1. **Hot Tier:**
   - **Use Case:** For data that is accessed frequently.
   - **Characteristics:** Highest storage cost, lowest access cost. Best for data needing quick access.

2. **Cool Tier:**
   - **Use Case:** For data that is infrequently accessed but needs to be online, stored for at least 30 days.
   - **Characteristics:** Lower storage costs than Hot, higher access costs.

3. **Cold Tier:**
   - **Use Case:** For data accessed even less often, stored for at least 90 days.
   - **Characteristics:** Further reduces storage costs compared to Cool, with higher retrieval costs.

4. **Archive Tier:**
   - **Use Case:** For data that can tolerate several hours of latency when retrieved and is stored for at least 180 days.
   - **Characteristics:** The lowest storage cost but the highest access cost due to the offline nature of the tier.

**Important Note on Storage Limits:**
- Storage limits apply at the account level, not per tier. This means you can distribute your storage usage across tiers as needed without worrying about tier-specific limits.

---

These notes provide a summary of how data lifecycle management works with Azure Blob Storage, focusing on the different access tiers available to optimize for access frequency and cost efficiency.

---

### **Manage the Data Lifecycle in Azure Blob Storage**

Azure Blob Storage lifecycle management allows for defining policies to:

- **Optimize Performance:** Transition blobs from cool to hot tier when accessed.
- **Optimize Costs:** Move blobs to cooler tiers based on inactivity.
- **Lifecycle End Management:** Delete blobs at the end of their lifecycle.

#### **Lifecycle Management Capabilities:**

1. **Tier Transition:**
   - **Cool to Hot:** Automatically move blobs to the hot tier for immediate access optimization.
   - **Hot/Cool to Cooler Tiers:** Transition blobs, their previous versions, or snapshots to a cooler tier (like cool, cold, or archive) if they haven't been accessed or modified for a specified time, reducing costs.

2. **Data Expiration:**
   - **Deletion:** Automatically delete blobs, previous versions, or snapshots when they reach the end of their lifecycle.

3. **Policy Scope:**
   - Policies can be applied at:
     - **Account Level:** Affect all blobs within the storage account.
     - **Container Level:** Target specific containers.
     - **Blob Level:** Use filters like name prefixes or blob index tags to apply rules to subsets of blobs.

#### **Example Scenario:**

- **Initial Stage:** Data is frequently accessed, hence stored in the **Hot** tier for optimal access speed.
  
- **Two Weeks Later:** Access becomes occasional, so data is transitioned to the **Cool** tier to balance access costs with performance.

- **After One Month:** Data is rarely accessed, making the **Archive** tier ideal for long-term storage at the lowest cost.

**Sample Lifecycle Management Policy (JSON):**

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "name": "accessTierTransitionRule",
      "enabled": true,
      "type": "Lifecycle",
      "definition": {
        "actions": {
          "baseBlob": {
            "tierToCool": { "daysAfterModificationGreaterThan": 14 },
            "tierToArchive": { "daysAfterModificationGreaterThan": 30 }
          }
        },
        "filters": {
          "blobTypes": ["blockBlob"],
          "prefixMatch": ["container1/folder1/"]
        }
      }
    },
    {
      "name": "deleteOldBlobsRule",
      "enabled": true,
      "type": "Lifecycle",
      "definition": {
        "actions": {
          "baseBlob": {
            "delete": { "daysAfterModificationGreaterThan": 365 }
          }
        },
        "filters": {
          "blobTypes": ["blockBlob"],
          "prefixMatch": ["container2/folder2/"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

- **Explanation:**
  - The first rule transitions blobs to **Cool** 14 days after modification and to **Archive** after 30 days within `container1/folder1/`.
  - The second rule deletes blobs after one year in `container2/folder2/`.

#### **Key Takeaway:**
By leveraging lifecycle management policies, you can dynamically manage your data's storage based on its lifecycle phase, ensuring cost efficiency without compromising on performance when needed.

### **Discover Blob Storage Lifecycle Policies**

#### **Overview:**
A lifecycle management policy in Azure Blob Storage is defined as a JSON document consisting of rules. Each rule specifies actions to be taken on blobs based on filters.

#### **Policy Structure:**

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "name": "rule1",
      "enabled": true,
      "type": "Lifecycle",
      "definition": {
        "actions": {
          // Actions to be performed
        },
        "filters": {
          // Filters that define the scope of blobs this rule applies to
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

#### **Policy Parameters:**

- **rules**: 
  - **Type:** Array of rule objects
  - **Notes:** A policy must have at least one rule, with a maximum of 100 rules allowed.

#### **Rule Parameters:**

| **Parameter Name** | **Parameter Type** | **Notes** | **Required** |
|--------------------|--------------------|-----------|--------------|
| **name**           | String             | Can include up to 256 alphanumeric characters. Case-sensitive and must be unique within a policy. | True |
| **enabled**        | Boolean            | Defaults to `true`. Can be used to temporarily disable a rule. | False |
| **type**           | Enum               | Must be set to `"Lifecycle"`. | True |
| **definition**     | Object             | Contains `actions` and `filters` to define the lifecycle rule. | True |

#### **Key Points:**

- **Filters:** Allow rules to target specific sets of blobs within a container or by name prefixes.
- **Actions:** Define what happens to the filtered blobs, like tiering (moving to a different access tier) or deletion.

This structure allows for fine-grained control over how data is managed over time, enabling cost optimization by moving data to appropriate storage tiers or removing unnecessary data.

---

### **Rules in Azure Blob Storage Lifecycle Management**

Each rule in a lifecycle management policy consists of:

- **Filter Set:** Defines the scope of blobs the rule applies to.
- **Action Set:** Specifies what actions (tiering or deletion) are performed on the filtered blobs.

#### **Sample Rule Example:**

```json
{
  "rules": [
    {
      "enabled": true,
      "name": "sample-rule",
      "type": "Lifecycle",
      "definition": {
        "actions": {
          "version": {
            "delete": { "daysAfterCreationGreaterThan": 90 }
          },
          "baseBlob": {
            "tierToCool": { "daysAfterModificationGreaterThan": 30 },
            "tierToArchive": {
              "daysAfterModificationGreaterThan": 90,
              "daysAfterLastTierChangeGreaterThan": 7
            },
            "delete": { "daysAfterModificationGreaterThan": 2555 }
          }
        },
        "filters": {
          "blobTypes": ["blockBlob"],
          "prefixMatch": ["sample-container/blob1"]
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

**Explanation of Actions:**
- **tierToCool:** Moves the blob to the Cool tier 30 days after last modification.
- **tierToArchive:** Moves to Archive tier 90 days after last modification, ensuring at least 7 days have passed since the last tier change.
- **delete:** Deletes the blob after 2,555 days (about 7 years) from last modification.
- **Delete Snapshots:** Deletes blob snapshots 90 days after they're created.

#### **Rule Filters:**

- **blobTypes:** Must be defined, specifies the type of blob this rule applies to (e.g., `blockBlob`).
- **prefixMatch:** Optional, matches blobs starting with a specified prefix, up to 10 prefixes per rule.
- **blobIndexMatch:** Optional, matches blobs based on blob index tag conditions.

**Note:** Multiple filters use a logical AND operation.

#### **Rule Actions:**

- **Action Types:**
  - **tierToCool, tierToCold, tierToArchive:** For moving blobs to respective tiers.
  - **enableAutoTierToHotFromCool:** Automatically moves blobs back to Hot from Cool when accessed (not for snapshots).
  - **delete:** Deletes blobs, snapshots, or previous versions.

**Action Priority:**
- If multiple actions are defined, the least expensive action is applied. For example, `delete` is cheaper than `tierToArchive`.

#### **Action Run Conditions:**

- **daysAfterModificationGreaterThan:** Used for base blob actions.
- **daysAfterCreationGreaterThan:** For blob snapshot actions.
- **daysAfterLastAccessTimeGreaterThan:** For current versions with access tracking enabled.
- **daysAfterLastTierChangeGreaterThan:** Ensures a blob stays in a tier for a minimum duration before archiving.

These conditions help in defining precise lifecycle management rules to optimize storage costs based on data usage patterns.

---

### **Implement Blob Storage Lifecycle Policies**

#### **Methods to Manage Lifecycle Policies:**

- **Azure Portal**
- **Azure PowerShell**
- **Azure CLI**
- **REST APIs**

#### **Azure Portal Implementation:**

1. **Code View Method:**

   - Navigate to your **Storage Account** in the Azure portal.
   - Under **Data management**, select **Lifecycle Management**.
   - Switch to the **Code View** tab to define your policy in JSON format.

   **Example Policy in JSON:**

   ```json
   {
     "rules": [
       {
         "enabled": true,
         "name": "move-to-cool",
         "type": "Lifecycle",
         "definition": {
           "actions": {
             "baseBlob": {
               "tierToCool": {
                 "daysAfterModificationGreaterThan": 30
               }
             }
           },
           "filters": {
             "blobTypes": ["blockBlob"],
             "prefixMatch": ["sample-container/log"]
           }
         }
       }
     ]
   }
   ```
   - This policy targets block blobs starting with "log" in the "sample-container" and moves them to the Cool tier if they haven't been modified for 30 days.

2. **List View Method:** (Not detailed here, but involves using the UI to set rules visually.)

#### **Azure CLI Implementation:**

- **Policy Creation:**

  You first need to define your policy in a JSON file (e.g., `policy.json`). Then use the Azure CLI to apply the policy:

  ```bash
  az storage account management-policy create \
      --account-name <storage-account> \
      --policy @policy.json \
      --resource-group <resource-group>
  ```

- **Notes:**
  - Replace `<storage-account>` with your storage account name.
  - Replace `<resource-group>` with the name of the resource group where your storage account resides.
  - The `@policy.json` reads the policy from a local file named `policy.json`.

**Important:** 
- Lifecycle policies need to be read or written in their entirety; partial updates are not supported. If you need to modify a policy, you must replace the entire policy document.

### **Rehydrate Blob Data from the Archive Tier**

#### **Overview:**
Archived blobs are offline and cannot be accessed directly. Rehydration is necessary to make them accessible again.

#### **Rehydration Methods:**

1. **Copy to Online Tier:**
   - **Operation:** Use `Copy Blob` or `Copy Blob from URL` to make a new online version of the blob.
   - **Recommended:** Preferred method by Microsoft for most scenarios.

   ```bash
   # Example using Azure CLI to copy an archived blob to a hot tier
   az storage blob copy start \
     --account-name <storage-account> \
     --destination-blob <destination-blob-name> \
     --source-blob <source-blob-name> \
     --destination-container <destination-container> \
     --source-container <source-container> \
     --tier Hot
   ```

2. **Change Blob's Access Tier:**
   - **Operation:** Use `Set Blob Tier` to change the tier directly.

   ```bash
   # Example using Azure CLI to change the tier of an archived blob to Hot
   az storage blob tier \
     --account-name <storage-account> \
     --container-name <container-name> \
     --name <blob-name> \
     --tier Hot
   ```

#### **Rehydration Considerations:**

- **Time:** The process can take several hours.
- **Performance:** Rehydrating larger blobs is recommended for better performance.
- **Multiple Small Blobs:** Rehydrating numerous small blobs at the same time might increase completion time.

#### **Rehydration Priority:**

- **Standard Priority:**
  - **Time:** Might take up to 15 hours.
  - **Usage:** Default option, processed in the order received.

- **High Priority:**
  - **Time:** Can complete in under an hour for blobs smaller than 10 GB.
  - **Usage:** Use when you need the data quickly.

**Checking Rehydration Status:**

- Use `Get Blob Properties` to check the `x-ms-rehydrate-priority` header, which will show either `Standard` or `High`.

```bash
# Example using Azure CLI to get blob properties
az storage blob show \
  --account-name <storage-account> \
  --container-name <container-name> \
  --name <blob-name> \
  --query "properties.rehydratePriority"
```

---

These notes outline the process and considerations for rehydrating archived blobs in Azure Blob Storage, providing examples of how to perform these operations using Azure CLI.

---

### **Rehydration Methods for Archived Blobs**

#### **Copy an Archived Blob to an Online Tier:**

- **Method:** Use the `Copy Blob` operation to create a new online blob in either the Hot or Cool tier.
  - The source archived blob remains unchanged.
  - **Restrictions:** 
    - For service versions before 2021-02-12, copying is limited within the same storage account.
    - From service version 2021-02-12, cross-account copying is allowed if both accounts are in the same region.

**Example Command:**

```bash
az storage blob copy start \
  --account-name <source-account> \
  --destination-blob <new-blob-name> \
  --source-blob <archived-blob-name> \
  --destination-container <destination-container> \
  --source-container <source-container> \
  --tier Hot
```

#### **Change a Blob's Access Tier to an Online Tier:**

- **Operation:** `Set Blob Tier` allows you to directly change the tier of an archived blob to Hot or Cool.
  - **Note:** This operation cannot be canceled once started.
  - **Blob Properties:** During rehydration, the blob's access tier still appears as "archived" until the process completes.

**Example Command:**

```bash
az storage blob tier \
  --account-name <storage-account> \
  --container-name <container-name> \
  --name <blob-name> \
  --tier Cool
```

**Caution:**

- Changing the tier does not update the last modified time.
- If there's a lifecycle management policy, the blob might be automatically moved back to the archive tier post-rehydration if the policy's conditions are met based on the unchanged last modified time.

### **Explore Azure Blob Storage Client Library for .NET**

#### **Overview:**
The Azure Storage client libraries for .NET provide a high-level interface for interacting with Azure Blob Storage. **Version 12.x** is the latest and recommended version for new applications.

#### **Core Classes:**

| **Class**              | **Description**                                                                                                                                                     |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **BlobClient**          | Enables operations on individual blobs like uploading, downloading, copying, and deleting.                                                                          |
| **BlobClientOptions**   | Configures client behavior, including retry policies, logging, and telemetry when connecting to Blob Storage.                                                       |
| **BlobContainerClient** | Used for managing blob containers, including creating, deleting, or listing containers, and performing operations on all blobs within a container.                  |
| **BlobServiceClient**   | Manages operations at the storage account level, allowing access to containers within the account.                                                                  |
| **BlobUriBuilder**      | Helps in constructing URIs to Azure Blob Storage resources dynamically. This is useful for building URLs to blobs, containers, or the storage service itself.       |

#### **Relevant Packages for Blob Storage:**

- **Azure.Storage.Blobs:**
  - Includes primary client objects (`BlobClient`, `BlobContainerClient`, `BlobServiceClient`).
  - Used for general operations on Blob Storage resources.

- **Azure.Storage.Blobs.Specialized:**
  - Contains specialized classes for specific blob types like `BlockBlobClient`, `AppendBlobClient`, and `PageBlobClient`.
  - Useful for operations tailored to the unique characteristics of different blob types.

- **Azure.Storage.Blobs.Models:**
  - Encompasses additional classes, structures, and enums that serve as utility types for Blob Storage operations.

#### **Using the Library:**

**Example to Create a BlobContainerClient:**

```csharp
BlobServiceClient blobServiceClient = new BlobServiceClient(connectionString);
BlobContainerClient containerClient = blobServiceClient.GetBlobContainerClient(containerName);
```

**Uploading a Blob:**

```csharp
BlobClient blobClient = containerClient.GetBlobClient("myblob");
await blobClient.UploadAsync("path/to/local/file.txt", true);
```

**Remember:**
- Always use the latest stable version of the library to take advantage of new features, improvements, and security patches.
- The client library abstracts much of the complexity of dealing with Azure Storage directly via REST APIs, making development more straightforward.

---

### **Create a Client Object with Azure Blob Storage SDK**

#### **Overview:**
To interact with Azure Blob Storage resources (storage accounts, containers, blobs) using the SDK, you first need to create client objects.

#### **Key Points:**

1. **Client Creation:**
   - Client objects are created by passing a URI and credentials to the respective client constructor.
   - URIs can be manually constructed or dynamically fetched using Azure Storage management libraries.

2. **Authentication:**
   - `DefaultAzureCredential` is used for authentication, providing an access token for Azure Entra (formerly Azure AD) security principal.
   - The security principal must have the necessary Azure RBAC role assignments for blob data access.

3. **BlobServiceClient:**
   - This client interacts with the storage account level, allowing operations like:
     - Retrieving and configuring account properties.
     - Listing, creating, or deleting containers.

**Example of Creating a `BlobServiceClient`:**

```csharp
using Azure.Identity;
using Azure.Storage.Blobs;

public BlobServiceClient GetBlobServiceClient(string accountName)
{
    // Construct the URI for the Blob storage endpoint
    BlobServiceClient client = new(
        new Uri($"https://{accountName}.blob.core.windows.net"), // Endpoint URI
        new DefaultAzureCredential()); // Credential for authentication

    return client;
}
```

**Notes:**
- `DefaultAzureCredential` tries various credential sources, making it versatile for development, testing, and production environments.
- The `BlobServiceClient` created here can then be used to perform operations on containers or blobs within the specified storage account.

---

### **Client Objects for Specific Blob Storage Resources**

#### **Create a `BlobContainerClient` Object:**

- **From `BlobServiceClient`:**
  - This method is useful when you need to manage multiple containers or perform operations at the account level before focusing on a specific container.

```csharp
public BlobContainerClient GetBlobContainerClient(
    BlobServiceClient blobServiceClient, 
    string containerName)
{
    // Create a container client from the service client
    BlobContainerClient client = blobServiceClient.GetBlobContainerClient(containerName);
    return client;
}
```

- **Directly:**
  - Ideal for scenarios where your operations are focused on a single container.

```csharp
public BlobContainerClient GetBlobContainerClient(
    string accountName,
    string containerName,
    BlobClientOptions clientOptions)
{
    // Directly create a container client with the full URI
    BlobContainerClient client = new(
        new Uri($"https://{accountName}.blob.core.windows.net/{containerName}"),
        new DefaultAzureCredential(),
        clientOptions);

    return client;
}
```

#### **Create a `BlobClient` Object:**

- `BlobClient` is used for operations on individual blobs, like uploading, downloading, or deleting a blob.

```csharp
public BlobClient GetBlobClient(
    BlobServiceClient blobServiceClient, 
    string containerName, 
    string blobName)
{
    // Create a blob client from the container client
    BlobClient client = 
        blobServiceClient.GetBlobContainerClient(containerName).GetBlobClient(blobName);
    return client;
}
```

**Notes:**
- `BlobContainerClient` provides methods to manage the container and its blobs, like creating, listing, or deleting blobs.
- `BlobClient` is tailored for operations on a single blob, offering fine-grained control over blob-specific tasks.
- Using `BlobClientOptions` allows you to customize the behavior of the client, like setting retry policies or specifying how the client should handle HTTP requests.

   cd az204-blob
   dotnet build
   ```
   - Move into the project directory and ensure it builds correctly.

3. **Create Data Directory:**
   ```bash
   mkdir data
   ```
   - This directory will hold blob data files.

4. **Install Azure Blob Storage Client Library:**
   ```bash
   dotnet add package Azure.Storage.Blobs
   ```

5. **Modify `Program.cs`:**
   Replace the contents of `Program.cs` with:

   ```csharp
   using Azure.Storage.Blobs;
   using Azure.Storage.Blobs.Models;

   Console.WriteLine("Azure Blob Storage exercise\n");

   // Run the examples asynchronously, wait for the results before proceeding
   ProcessAsync().GetAwaiter().GetResult();

   Console.WriteLine("Press enter to exit the sample application.");
   Console.ReadLine();

   static async Task ProcessAsync()
   {
       // Copy the connection string from the portal in the variable below.
       string storageConnectionString = "CONNECTION STRING";

       // Create a client that can authenticate with a connection string
       BlobServiceClient blobServiceClient = new BlobServiceClient(storageConnectionString);

       // COPY EXAMPLE CODE BELOW HERE
   }
   ```

#### **Next Steps:**

- **Set Connection String:** Replace `"CONNECTION STRING"` with the actual connection string you copied from the Azure portal.

- **Implement Blob Storage Operations:** 
  - You'll need to add code within the `ProcessAsync` method to perform operations like creating containers, uploading, listing, downloading, and deleting blobs.

Ensure the terminal remains open for building and running the application as you progress through the exercise.

---

### **Build the Full App for Azure Blob Storage Interaction**

#### **Create a Container:**

- **Objective:** Create a uniquely named container in your Azure Blob Storage account.

- **Code Snippet to Add to `Program.cs`:**

```csharp
// Create a unique name for the container
string containerName = "wtblob" + Guid.NewGuid().ToString();

// Create the container and return a container client object
BlobContainerClient containerClient = await blobServiceClient.CreateBlobContainerAsync(containerName);
Console.WriteLine("A container named '" + containerName + "' has been created. " +
    "\nTake a minute and verify in the portal." + 
    "\nNext a file will be created and uploaded to the container.");
Console.WriteLine("Press 'Enter' to continue.");
Console.ReadLine();
```

**Notes:**
- A `GUID` is used to ensure the container name is unique, preventing conflicts if the app is run multiple times.
- `CreateBlobContainerAsync` is used to create the container. If a container with the same name exists, this method will throw an exception. Ensure you handle or check for existing containers if this behavior is not desired.

**Next Steps:**
- After this snippet, continue by adding code for uploading blobs to the newly created container. Remember to keep appending new functionalities sequentially in the `ProcessAsync` method.

---

#### **Upload Blobs to a Container:**

- **Objective:** Upload a local file to the container created earlier.

- **Code Snippet to Add to `Program.cs`:**

```csharp
// Create a local file in the ./data/ directory for uploading and downloading
string localPath = "./data/";
string fileName = "wtfile" + Guid.NewGuid().ToString() + ".txt";
string localFilePath = Path.Combine(localPath, fileName);

// Write text to the file
await File.WriteAllTextAsync(localFilePath, "Hello, World!");

// Get a reference to the blob
BlobClient blobClient = containerClient.GetBlobClient(fileName);

Console.WriteLine("Uploading to Blob storage as blob:\n\t {0}\n", blobClient.Uri);

// Open the file and upload its data
using (FileStream uploadFileStream = File.OpenRead(localFilePath))
{
    await blobClient.UploadAsync(uploadFileStream);
    uploadFileStream.Close();
}

Console.WriteLine("\nThe file was uploaded. We'll verify by listing" + 
        " the blobs next.");
Console.WriteLine("Press 'Enter' to continue.");
Console.ReadLine();
```

**Notes:**
- A new file is created with a unique name using `Guid`.
- `UploadAsync` is used to upload the file to Blob Storage, creating a new blob if it doesn't exist or overwriting if it does.

---

#### **List the Blobs in a Container:**

- **Objective:** List all blobs within the container to verify the upload.

- **Code Snippet to Add to `Program.cs`:**

```csharp
// List blobs in the container
Console.WriteLine("Listing blobs...");
await foreach (BlobItem blobItem in containerClient.GetBlobsAsync())
{
    Console.WriteLine("\t" + blobItem.Name);
}

Console.WriteLine("\nYou can also verify by looking inside the " + 
        "container in the portal." +
        "\nNext the blob will be downloaded with an altered file name.");
Console.WriteLine("Press 'Enter' to continue.");
Console.ReadLine();
```

**Notes:**
- `GetBlobsAsync` is used to retrieve an asynchronous enumerable of `BlobItem` which represents blobs in the container.
- This snippet will list the name of the blob just uploaded, confirming its presence in the container.

---

#### **Download Blobs:**

- **Objective:** Download the previously uploaded blob to the local file system.

- **Code Snippet to Add to `Program.cs`:**

```csharp
// Download the blob to a local file
// Append the string "DOWNLOADED" before the .txt extension 
string downloadFilePath = localFilePath.Replace(".txt", "DOWNLOADED.txt");

Console.WriteLine("\nDownloading blob to\n\t{0}\n", downloadFilePath);

// Download the blob's contents and save it to a file
BlobDownloadInfo download = await blobClient.DownloadAsync();

using (FileStream downloadFileStream = File.OpenWrite(downloadFilePath))
{
    await download.Content.CopyToAsync(downloadFileStream);
}
Console.WriteLine("\nLocate the local file in the data directory created earlier to verify it was downloaded.");
Console.WriteLine("The next step is to delete the container and local files.");
Console.WriteLine("Press 'Enter' to continue.");
Console.ReadLine();
```

**Notes:**
- A new file name is created by appending "DOWNLOADED" to distinguish it from the original local file.
- `DownloadAsync` retrieves the blob content, which is then written to a local file using a `FileStream`.

---

#### **Delete a Container:**

- **Objective:** Clean up by deleting the container and removing local files.

- **Code Snippet to Add to `Program.cs`:**

```csharp
// Delete the container and clean up local files created
Console.WriteLine("\n\nDeleting blob container...");
await containerClient.DeleteAsync();

Console.WriteLine("Deleting the local source and downloaded files...");
File.Delete(localFilePath);
File.Delete(downloadFilePath);

Console.WriteLine("Finished cleaning up.");
```

**Notes:**
- `DeleteAsync` is called on the container client to delete the container and all blobs inside it.
- Local files created during the exercise are also deleted to ensure a clean state afterward.

---

#### **Run the Code:**

- **Objective:** Execute the completed application to see the operations in action.

- **Steps:**

  1. **Ensure you're in the application directory.**

  2. **Build the application:**

     ```bash
     dotnet build
     ```

  3. **Run the application:**

     ```bash
     dotnet run
     ```

**Notes:**
- The application will pause at various points with prompts, allowing you to check the Azure portal for changes after each operation (container creation, blob upload, listing, download, and deletion).

---

#### **Clean Up Other Resources:**

- **Objective:** Remove any remaining Azure resources used in the exercise.

- **Command to Delete Resource Group:**

  ```bash
  az group delete --name az204-blob-rg --no-wait
  ```

**Notes:**
- This command deletes the entire resource group `az204-blob-rg`, which includes the storage account and any other resources created within it.
- The `--no-wait` flag allows the command to execute without waiting for the operation to complete, which can be useful for long-running operations or when you want to continue with other tasks immediately. However, it's worth noting that this means you won't receive immediate feedback on whether the deletion was successful.

### **Manage Container Properties and Metadata by Using .NET**

#### **Overview:**
Azure Blob Storage containers support:

- **System Properties:** These are inherent properties of Blob storage resources, managed by Azure. Some can be read or modified, while others are read-only.

- **User-Defined Metadata:** Custom name-value pairs that users can set on Blob storage resources for additional context or data.

#### **System Properties:**

- They relate to standard HTTP headers and are managed by the Azure Storage client library.

#### **User-Defined Metadata:**

- Can be set by the user.
- Must follow HTTP header rules:
  - Names must be valid HTTP headers and C# identifiers.
  - Only ASCII characters are allowed in names.
  - Case-insensitive.
  - Non-ASCII values should be encoded (Base64 or URL-encoded).

#### **Retrieve Container Properties:**

- Use `GetProperties` or `GetPropertiesAsync` methods of `BlobContainerClient` to fetch container properties.

**Example Code to Read Container Properties:**

```csharp
private static async Task ReadContainerPropertiesAsync(BlobContainerClient container)
{
    try
    {
        // Fetch some container properties and write out their values.
        var properties = await container.GetPropertiesAsync();
        Console.WriteLine($"Properties for container {container.Uri}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Public access level: {properties.Value.PublicAccess}");
        Console.WriteLine($"Last modified time in UTC: {properties.Value.LastModified}");
    }
    catch (RequestFailedException e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"HTTP error code {e.Status}: {e.ErrorCode}");
        Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}
```

**Notes:**
- This example shows how to retrieve and display the `PublicAccess` level and `LastModified` time of a container.
- Error handling is implemented to catch and display information about any `RequestFailedException` that might occur during the operation.

---

### **Set and Retrieve Metadata for Azure Blob Storage Containers**

#### **Setting Metadata:**

- Metadata for containers can be set using name-value pairs stored in an `IDictionary<string, string>`.
- Use `SetMetadata` or `SetMetadataAsync` of `BlobContainerClient` to apply the metadata.

**Example Code to Set Container Metadata:**

```csharp
public static async Task AddContainerMetadataAsync(BlobContainerClient container)
{
    try
    {
        IDictionary<string, string> metadata = new Dictionary<string, string>();

        // Add some metadata to the container.
        metadata.Add("docType", "textDocuments");
        metadata.Add("category", "guidance");

        // Set the container's metadata.
        await container.SetMetadataAsync(metadata);
    }
    catch (RequestFailedException e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"HTTP error code {e.Status}: {e.ErrorCode}");
        Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}
```

#### **Key Points:**
- Metadata names should conform to C# identifier naming rules but are case-insensitive when accessed.
- If duplicate metadata names are provided, values are concatenated with commas.

#### **Retrieving Metadata:**

- Metadata can be retrieved along with properties using `GetProperties` or `GetPropertiesAsync`.

**Example Code to Read Container Metadata:**

```csharp
public static async Task ReadContainerMetadataAsync(BlobContainerClient container)
{
    try
    {
        var properties = await container.GetPropertiesAsync();

        // Enumerate the container's metadata.
        Console.WriteLine("Container metadata:");
        foreach (var metadataItem in properties.Value.Metadata)
        {
            Console.WriteLine($"\tKey: {metadataItem.Key}");
            Console.WriteLine($"\tValue: {metadataItem.Value}");
        }
    }
    catch (RequestFailedException e)
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"HTTP error code {e.Status}: {e.ErrorCode}");
        Console.WriteLine(e.Message);
        Console.ReadLine();
    }
}
```

**Notes:**
- The example iterates over the metadata dictionary to display each key-value pair.
- Error handling is included in both examples to manage potential issues like network errors or unauthorized access.

---

### **Set and Retrieve Properties and Metadata for Blob Resources Using REST**

#### **Metadata Header Format:**

- Metadata headers follow the format:

```plaintext
x-ms-meta-name:string-value
```

- **Since version 2009-09-19**, metadata names must follow C# identifier naming conventions.
  
- Names are case-insensitive when set or read, but the original case is preserved.
- Duplicate metadata names cause a `400 (Bad Request)` error.

**Key Points:**
- Total metadata size can be up to 8 KB.
- Metadata must adhere to HTTP header constraints.

#### **Operations on Metadata:**

- Metadata can be added, updated, or retrieved without altering the resource's content.
- Full metadata must be read or written; partial updates aren't supported.

#### **Retrieving Properties and Metadata:**

- **For Containers:** Use `GET` or `HEAD` with the following URI:

```plaintext
GET/HEAD https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer?restype=container
```

- **For Blobs:** Use `GET` or `HEAD` with:

```plaintext
GET/HEAD https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myblob?comp=metadata
```

**Notes:**
- These operations return only headers, not the actual content of the blob or container.
- `GET` will fetch the metadata, whereas `HEAD` will return only the headers without downloading the resource's content, which is more efficient for just checking metadata.

---

### **Setting Metadata Headers for Blob Storage Resources**

#### **PUT Operation for Metadata:**

- **For Containers:** Use `PUT` with the following URI:

  ```plaintext
  PUT https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer?comp=metadata&restype=container
  ```

- **For Blobs:** Use `PUT` with:

  ```plaintext
  PUT https://myaccount.blob.core.windows.net/mycontainer/myblob?comp=metadata
  ```

**Notes:**
- The `PUT` operation with metadata headers will overwrite existing metadata or clear all metadata if no headers are provided in the request.

#### **Standard HTTP Properties:**

- Both containers and blobs support standard HTTP properties alongside custom metadata:

  - **For Containers:**
    - `ETag`
    - `Last-Modified`

  - **For Blobs:**
    - `ETag`
    - `Last-Modified`
    - `Content-Length`
    - `Content-Type`
    - `Content-MD5`
    - `Content-Encoding`
    - `Content-Language`
    - `Cache-Control`
    - `Origin`
    - `Range`

**Key Points:**
- Metadata headers start with `x-ms-meta-`, whereas property headers use standard HTTP names as defined in the HTTP/1.1 protocol.
- Properties like `ETag` and `Last-Modified` are crucial for versioning and synchronization, while others like `Content-Type` and `Content-Encoding` define how the blob's content should be interpreted or handled.
