  - **Documentation:**[App Service GitHub login](link to doc)

Each provider's endpoint is used for user authentication and token validation.

#### **How Authentication and Authorization Works**

- **Module Execution:** 
  - The authentication module operates in the same sandbox as your application for Windows, but in a separate container for Linux and custom containers.

- **Request Handling:**
  - **Authentication:** Handles user and client authentication with the specified identity provider.
  - **Token Management:** Validates, stores, and refreshes OAuth tokens.
  - **Session Management:** Manages the authenticated session state.
  - **Header Injection:** Injects identity information into HTTP headers.

- **Configuration:**
  - Can be set up via Azure Resource Manager settings or a configuration file, without requiring SDKs or code changes.

- **Platform Independence:**
  - This system is language-agnostic, meaning you don't need to modify your application's code to utilize the authentication features.

**Note for Linux and Containers:**
  - Authentication runs in a separate, isolated container, which means there's no direct in-process integration with language frameworks.

#### **Example Configuration via Azure CLI:**

To enable authentication for an app with Microsoft Entra ID:

```bash
az webapp auth update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> \
  --enabled true --action AllowAnonymous \
  --aad-client-id <client-id> --aad-client-secret <client-secret> \
  --aad-issuer-url <issuer-url>
```

#### **Key Points:**

- **Multiple Providers:** You can configure multiple sign-in options for users.
- **No Code Changes:** Authentication can be enabled without altering your application's codebase.
- **Security Features:** 
  - Token management ensures secure and efficient handling of OAuth tokens.

#### **Conclusion:**

Azure App Service's authentication and authorization capabilities simplify securing your applications by offloading the complexities of identity management to trusted providers. This integration allows for a seamless setup where your application remains focused on its core functionality while the platform handles user identity and security.

### **Authentication Flow in Azure App Service**

#### **Overview:**

- **Provider SDK Usage:** The flow varies based on whether the application uses the identity provider's SDK or relies on App Service for authentication.

#### **Authentication Flow Steps:**

- **Without Provider SDK (Server-Directed Flow):**
  1. **Sign User In:**
     - Redirects to `/.auth/login/<provider>`.

  2. **Post-Authentication:**
     - Provider redirects back to `/.auth/login/<provider>/callback`.

  3. **Establish Authenticated Session:**
     - App Service adds an authenticated cookie to the response.

  4. **Serve Authenticated Content:**
     - Client includes the authentication cookie in subsequent requests (handled by the browser).

- **With Provider SDK (Client-Directed Flow):**
  1. **Sign User In:**
     - Client code uses the provider's SDK to authenticate and receive a token.
     - See provider's documentation for specifics.

  2. **Post-Authentication:**
     - Client code sends the token to `/.auth/login/<provider>` for validation.

  3. **Establish Authenticated Session:**
     - App Service returns its authentication token.

  4. **Serve Authenticated Content:**
     - Client presents the token in the `X-ZUMO-AUTH` header (handled by Mobile Apps client SDKs).

**Note:** For browser clients, App Service can automatically redirect unauthenticated users to `/.auth/login/<provider>`.

#### **Authorization Behavior Configuration:**

- **Allow Unauthenticated Requests:**
  - Authentication is deferred to your application code.
  - Authenticated requests include authentication info in headers.
  - Useful for presenting multiple sign-in options or handling anonymous requests.

- **Require Authentication:**
  - Rejects unauthenticated traffic:
    - **Redirect:** Sends the user to `/.auth/login/<provider>`.
    - **HTTP 401 Unauthorized:** For native mobile apps or when configured to return unauthorized.
    - **HTTP 403 Forbidden:** Can be set as the rejection response.

**Caution:** 
  - Requiring authentication for all calls might not be suitable for apps with public pages, like single-page applications.

#### **Configuration via Azure Portal:**

- **Authentication Settings:**
  - Navigate to your App Service in the Azure portal.
  - Go to **Authentication / Authorization** under **Settings**.
  - **Toggle Authentication:** On.
  - **Choose Action:** Select how to handle unauthenticated requests (Allow or Require).

#### **Example Configuration via Azure CLI:**

To configure App Service to require authentication with redirection:

```bash
az webapp auth update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> \
  --enabled true --action LoginWithMicrosoftAccount
```

#### **Conclusion:**

Azure App Service provides a flexible authentication framework that can operate with or without direct integration with provider SDKs. The choice between server-directed and client-directed flows depends on your application's nature and interaction with users. The authorization settings allow you to control access to your application, balancing between security and user experience.

    az webapp config hostname add --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --hostname <custom-domain>
    ```

  - **Access Restrictions:**
    - Restricts access to your app based on IP addresses.
    ```bash
    # Add an IP restriction
    az webapp config access-restriction add --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --rule-name "AllowSpecificIP" --action Allow --ip-address <ip-address>
    ```

  - **Service Endpoints:**
    - Allows secure access to Azure services like Azure Storage from your app.

  - **Private Endpoints:**
    - Connects your app privately to Azure services or on-premises networks without internet exposure.

  **Outbound Traffic Control:**
  - **Hybrid Connections:**
    - Enables connectivity to on-premises systems securely.
    ```bash
    # Create a Hybrid Connection endpoint
    az relay hybrid-connection create --resource-group <resource-group-name> --namespace-name <namespace-name> --name <hybrid-connection-name> --type HybridConnection
    ```

  - **Gateway-required Virtual Network Integration:**
    - Allows your app to connect to resources in a virtual network via an Azure Application Gateway or a VPN Gateway.

  - **Virtual Network Integration:**
    - Enables your app to access resources within an Azure VNet.

#### **Inbound Use Cases:**

- **SSL Certificate Binding:**
  - **Feature:** App-assigned address for IP-based SSL.

- **Dedicated Inbound Address:**
  - **Feature:** App-assigned address to provide a unique inbound IP.

- **IP Whitelisting:**
  - **Feature:** Access restrictions to allow access only from specific IP addresses.

#### **Notes:**

- **Feature Compatibility:** Mixing features is possible, but there are limitations due to the nature of the multi-tenant environment.
- **Security:** By using these features, you can significantly enhance the security of your applications by controlling who can access them and how they communicate outward.

#### **Conclusion:**

Azure App Service networking features offer a robust set of tools for controlling both inbound and outbound traffic. These features allow developers to tailor network behavior to specific application requirements, ensuring both security and connectivity needs are met without compromising on performance or user experience.

### **Default Networking Behavior in Azure App Service**

#### **Overview:**

- **Scale Units:** Azure App Service runs on scale units that serve multiple customers.

- **VM Types:**
  - **Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, Premium:** Share similar worker VM types.
  - **PremiumV2:** Uses a different VM type.
  - **PremiumV3:** Uses yet another VM type.

#### **Outbound Addresses:**

- **Worker VMs and Outbound IPs:**
  - Apps share outbound IP addresses based on the VM family they run on.
  - Changing to a different VM family (like moving to PremiumV2 or PremiumV3) changes the set of outbound IPs.

- **Address Sharing:**
  - The outbound addresses are used by all apps on the same worker VM family within an App Service deployment.

#### **Finding Outbound IP Information:**

- **Azure Portal:**
  - Navigate to your app in the Azure portal.
  - Go to **Properties** in the left-hand navigation to view current outbound IP addresses.

- **Azure CLI Commands:**

  **Current Outbound IP Addresses:**
  ```bash
  az webapp show \
      --resource-group <group_name> \
      --name <app-name> \
      --query outboundIpAddresses \
      --output tsv
  ```

  **Possible Outbound IP Addresses (for all tiers):**
  ```bash
  az webapp show \
      --resource-group <group_name> \
      --name <app-name> \
      --query possibleOutboundIpAddresses \
      --output tsv
  ```

#### **Notes:**

- **Scaling:** When scaling out, all apps in the same App Service plan are replicated across new instances, but they will share the same set of outbound IPs unless you change VM families.

- **Predictability:** Knowing the possible outbound IPs is useful for firewall rules or when integrating with services that require IP whitelisting.

- **Multi-Tenant Implications:** In multi-tenant environments (Free and Shared), your app might share an outbound IP with other customers' apps, which might not be ideal for some scenarios.

#### **Conclusion:**

Understanding and managing outbound IP addresses in Azure App Service is crucial for applications that need to communicate externally or integrate with services that whitelist IPs. The ability to scale while maintaining or managing these addresses allows for flexible deployment strategies tailored to security and connectivity needs.

### Azure App Service Introduction

#### Key Concept: App Settings

- **Purpose**: App settings in Azure App Service are essentially environment variables that provide a way to configure your application without changing its code.

#### Learning Objectives:

1. **Create Application Settings**:
   - Application settings can be slot-specific or shared across deployment slots:
     ```plaintext
     az webapp config appsettings set --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --slot <slot-name> --settings <key>=<value>
     ```
   - For shared settings across all slots:
     ```plaintext
     az webapp config appsettings set --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --settings <key>=<value>
     ```

2. **SSL/TLS Certificates**:
   - Understanding how to secure your app with SSL/TLS:
     - **Import a certificate**: 
       ```plaintext
       az webapp config ssl import --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --cert-file <path-to-cert-file> --key-file <path-to-key-file> --password <certificate-password>
       ```
     - **Bind certificate to hostname**:
       ```plaintext
       az webapp config ssl bind --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --certificate-thumbprint <thumbprint> --ssl-type SNI
       ```

3. **Enable Diagnostic Logging**:
   - Log configuration for better debugging and monitoring:
     ```plaintext
     az webapp log config --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --application-logging filesystem --detailed-error-messages true --failed-request-tracing true
     ```

4. **Virtual App to Directory Mappings**:
   - Useful for structuring applications with different virtual paths mapping to physical directories:
     ```plaintext
     az webapp config set --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --virtual-applications '[{"virtualPath": "/myapp", "physicalPath": "site\\wwwroot\\myapp"}]'
     ```

**Note**: Always check the latest Azure CLI documentation for any updates or changes to command syntax.

These notes summarize the introduction to Azure App Service settings, focusing on application configuration, security, logging, and application structure management. Remember, each of these operations can be performed through the Azure Portal as well, but using the CLI can streamline your workflow, especially in automated environments or scripts.

#### Key Concepts:

- **Application Settings**: These are environment variables provided to your application code in Azure App Service. For Linux apps and custom containers, these are passed using the `--env` flag.

**Accessing Application Settings:**
- Navigate to your app's management page:
  - Go to **Environment variables** > **Application settings**.

**ASP.NET and ASP.NET Core Usage:**
- App settings in App Service override those in `Web.config` or `appsettings.json`.
- Local settings can be kept in `Web.config` or `appsettings.json`, while production secrets should reside in App Service for security.

**Security:**
- All app settings are encrypted at rest.

#### Adding and Editing Settings:

- **Single Setting Addition**: 
  - Select **+ Add** to add a new setting.
  - If using deployment slots, decide if the setting should be slot-specific or swappable.

- **Bulk Editing/Adding Settings**:
  - Use **Advanced edit** for bulk operations. Here's an example JSON format for app settings:
    ```json
    [
      {
        "name": "<key-1>",
        "value": "<value-1>",
        "slotSetting": false
      },
      {
        "name": "<key-2>",
        "value": "<value-2>",
        "slotSetting": false
      }
    ]
    ```

#### Configure Connection Strings:

- For ASP.NET/ASP.NET Core, connection strings in App Service override those in `Web.config`.
- For other languages, app settings are preferred unless you're using specific Azure database types for backups.

**Bulk Editing Connection Strings:**
- JSON format for connection strings:
  ```json
  [
    {
      "name": "name-1",
      "value": "conn-string-1",
      "type": "SQLServer",
      "slotSetting": false
    },
    {
      "name": "name-2",
      "value": "conn-string-2",
      "type": "PostgreSQL",
      "slotSetting": false
    }
  ]
  ```

**Note for .NET Apps with PostgreSQL:**
- Set the connection string type to **Custom** as a workaround for an issue in .NET.

#### Environment Variables for Custom Containers:

- To set environment variables for custom containers:
  - In **Bash** (Azure CLI):
    ```bash
    az webapp config appsettings set --resource-group <group-name> --name <app-name> --settings key1=value1 key2=value2
    ```
  - In **PowerShell** (Azure PowerShell):
    ```powershell
    Set-AzWebApp -ResourceGroupName <group-name> -Name <app-name> -AppSettings @{"DB_HOST"="myownserver.mysql.database.azure.com"}
    ```

- **Verification**:
  - Use the URL `https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/Env` to verify the environment variables in your running container.

Remember, when configuring your app, always apply your changes after editing to ensure they take effect.

#### General Settings Overview:

- Navigate to **Configuration > General settings** to manage these settings.

#### List of Available Settings:

**1. Stack Settings:**
- Define the software stack for your app:
  - Language and SDK versions.
  - For Linux and custom container apps:
    - Optional start-up command or file.

**2. Platform Settings:**

- **Platform Bitness**: Choose between 32-bit or 64-bit for Windows apps.
- **FTP State**: 
  - Options include allowing only FTPS or disabling FTP altogether.
- **HTTP Version**:
  - Set to `2.0` for HTTP/2 protocol support.
  ```plaintext
  # Note: Most browsers support HTTP/2 only over TLS. Ensure your custom DNS is secured for HTTP/2 use.
  ```
  
- **Web Sockets**: Enable for real-time features like ASP.NET SignalR or socket.io.
- **Always On**: 
  - Keeps the app loaded without traffic, preventing cold starts:
  ```plaintext
  # Set to ON for maintaining continuous WebJobs or CRON triggered jobs.
  ```
- **ARR Affinity**: 
  - Ensures session stickiness in multi-instance scenarios:
  ```plaintext
  # Set to OFF for stateless applications.
  ```
- **HTTPS Only**: 
  - Redirect all HTTP traffic to HTTPS.
- **Minimum TLS Version**: 
  - Choose the minimum TLS version your app will accept.
- **Debugging**: 
  - Enable remote debugging for specified app types. Automatically turns off after 48 hours.
- **Incoming Client Certificates**: 
  - For mutual TLS authentication, forcing clients to provide certificates for access.

**Important Notes:**
- **Scaling**: Some settings might require scaling to higher pricing tiers.
- **HTTP/2**: Remember to secure your custom DNS name for HTTP/2 usage due to TLS requirements in modern browsers.

These settings are crucial for optimizing your application's performance, security, and compatibility with various technologies and protocols. Always consider your application's specific needs when configuring these options.

#### Path Mappings Overview:

- Navigate to **Configuration > Path mappings** to configure handler mappings and virtual applications/directories.

#### Windows Apps (Uncontainerized)

**Handler Mappings:**
- Custom script processors can be added for specific file extensions:
  - **Extension**: File extension to handle (e.g., `*.php`, `handler.fcgi`).
  - **Script processor**: Path to the script processor (e.g., `D:\home\site\wwwroot` for app root).
    ```plaintext
    # Example configuration for a PHP handler:
    # Extension: *.php
    # Script processor: D:\home\site\wwwroot\php-cgi.exe
    # Arguments: (optional)
    ```
  - **Arguments**: Optional command-line arguments.

**Virtual Applications and Directories:**
- Default path `/` is mapped to `D:\home\site\wwwroot`.
- To configure:
  - Specify virtual directory and physical path relative to `D:\home`.
  - Uncheck **Directory** to mark a virtual directory as a web application.

#### Linux and Containerized Apps

**Custom Storage Mounts:**
- For Linux apps and custom containers (both Windows and Linux):
  - Select **New Azure Storage Mount** to add custom storage:

```plaintext
# Basic Configuration
Name: [Display name of the mount]
Storage accounts: [Select your storage account]
Storage type: [Azure Blobs or Azure Files; Windows containers support only Azure Files]
Storage container: [Select the container in basic setup]

# Advanced Configuration
Share name: [File share name for advanced setup]
Access key: [Access key for advanced setup]
Mount path: [Absolute path in container for mount point]
Deployment slot setting: [Check if this should apply to deployment slots]
```

**Notes:**
- **Azure Blobs** can only be mounted as read-only.
- **Deployment Slot Setting** ensures that storage mounts are consistent across deployment slots when checked.

These configurations allow you to customize how your application handles different file types and how it interacts with external storage, enhancing both functionality and performance based on your operational needs.

### Enable Diagnostic Logging

#### Diagnostic Logging Overview:

- Azure provides various types of logs to help debug and monitor your App Service applications. Here's a breakdown:

| **Type**                | **Platform** | **Location**                               | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
|-------------------------|--------------|--------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Application logging     | Windows, Linux | App Service file system and/or Azure Storage blobs | Logs messages from your application code.

**Notes:**
- **Application Logging**: 
  ```plaintext
  # You can configure this to log to the file system or Azure Blob storage.
  # Example configurations might involve setting up log levels and destinations:
  # az webapp log config --application-logging true --level information --web-server-logging filesystem
  ```

- **Web Server Logging**: 
  ```plaintext
  # Can be stored in the file system or Azure Blob storage.
  # az webapp log config --web-server-logging filesystem
  ```

- **Detailed Error Messages** and **Failed Request Tracing** are specific to Windows and offer deep insights into application errors and performance issues.

- **Deployment Logging**: 
  ```plaintext
  # This is automatic upon deployment, no configuration needed.
  ```

### Enable Application Logging

#### For Windows:

- To enable application logging for Windows apps:
  - Navigate to your app in the Azure portal.
  - Select **App Service logs**.

**Configuration Options:**
- **Application Logging (Filesystem)**:
  - Set to **On** for temporary debugging. Automatically turns off after 12 hours.
  - This is useful for quick, short-term troubleshooting.

- **Application Logging (Blob)**:
  - Set to **On** for long-term logging.
  - Requires a blob storage container. Here's how you might set it up:
    ```plaintext
    # Example Blob storage configuration
    # az webapp log config --application-logging blob --level information --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name>
    # --blob-storage-account <storage-account-name> --blob-container <container-name>
    ```

**Log Levels:**
- Set the logging level for detail control:
  ```plaintext
  # Log Levels:
  # - Disabled: No logging
  # - Error: Errors and Critical
  # - Warning: Warnings, Errors, and Critical
  # - Information: Info, Warning, Error, Critical
  # - Verbose: All categories (Trace, Debug, Info, Warning, Error, Critical)
  ```

- **After configuration, remember to select **Save** to apply changes.**

**Note:**
- If you regenerate storage account keys, you must:
  - Turn logging off and then on again to update the configuration with the new keys.

#### For Linux/Container:

- In **App Service logs**:
  - Set **Application logging** to **File System**.

**Quota and Retention:**
- **Quota (MB)**: Define the disk space allowed for logs.
  ```plaintext
  # Example configuration for quota
  # az webapp log config --application-logging filesystem --level information --name <app-name> --resource-group <resource-group-name> --quota 100
  ```

- **Retention Period (Days)**: Specify how long logs should be kept.
  ```plaintext
  # Example for retention period
  # az webapp log config --retention-in-days 7
  ```

- **When finished, select **Save** to apply the settings.**

These steps ensure you have the appropriate logging enabled for your Windows or Linux/Container apps in Azure, providing you with the necessary logs for debugging or monitoring purposes. Remember, for Linux apps, logs are only saved to the file system, not to Azure Blob Storage.

### Enable Web Server Logging

- To configure web server logging:
  - Select **Storage** for logs to be stored in blob storage, or **File System** for on-site storage on the App Service.

**Retention Period:**
- Set the **Retention Period (Days)** for how long logs should be kept.
  ```plaintext
  # Example for setting retention period
  # az webapp log config --web-server-logging filesystem --retention-in-days 30
  ```

- **When finished, select **Save** to apply the settings.**

### Add Log Messages in Code

**For ASP.NET:**
```csharp
System.Diagnostics.Trace.TraceError("If you're seeing this, something bad happened");
```

**For ASP.NET Core:**
- Uses `Microsoft.Extensions.Logging.AzureAppServices` by default.

**For Python:**
- Use the `OpenCensus` package to send logs.

### Stream Logs

- **Azure Portal**: 
  - Navigate to your app and select **Log stream**.

- **Azure CLI**: Use for live streaming in Cloud Shell:
  ```bash
  az webapp log tail --name appname --resource-group myResourceGroup
  ```

- **Local Console**:
  - Install Azure CLI, sign in, and follow the Azure CLI instructions.

### Access Log Files

**If using Azure Storage for Logs:**
- You'll need a client tool that works with Azure Storage to access the logs.

**For App Service File System Logs:**

- **Download Logs for Linux/Container Apps:**
  ```plaintext
  # URL for downloading logs
  # https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/api/logs/docker/zip
  ```

- **Download Logs for Windows Apps:**
  ```plaintext
  # URL for downloading logs
  # https://<app-name>.scm.azurewebsites.net/api/dump
  ```

**Notes:**
- For Linux/containers, the ZIP contains logs from both the docker host and container. For scaled-out apps, there's one set per instance.
- Logs are located in the `/home/LogFiles` directory on the App Service.

This setup allows you to configure where and how long logs are kept, log from within your application, stream logs in real-time, and retrieve them for analysis. Remember, some logs might not be in chronological order due to buffering.

### Configure Security Certificates

#### Overview:

- Azure App Service provides various options to manage certificates for securing data transmission:

| **Option**                               | **Description**                                                                                         |
|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Create a free App Service managed certificate | A no-cost private certificate for securing custom domains within App Service.                           |
| Purchase an App Service certificate      | A managed private certificate by Azure with features like automated management and flexible renewals.   |
| Import a certificate from Key Vault     | Suitable for integrating with Azure Key Vault for centralized certificate management.                   |
| Upload a private certificate            | For pre-existing certificates from third-party providers, you can upload directly to App Service.        |
| Upload a public certificate             | For public certificates needed in application code, not for domain security.                            |

#### Private Certificate Requirements:

- For certificates to be used in App Service, they must:

  - Be exported as a **password-protected PFX file** using triple DES encryption.
  - Have a **private key** of at least 2048 bits in length.
  - Include **all intermediate certificates** and the **root certificate** in the chain.

- For securing a custom domain with TLS binding, additional requirements are:

  - Must have an **Extended Key Usage** for server authentication (OID = 1.3.6.1.5.5.7.3.1).
  - Be signed by a **trusted certificate authority**.

**Notes:**
- Certificates uploaded to an app are stored within the deployment unit linked to the app service plan's resource group and region, making them available for other apps sharing the same environment.

This configuration ensures your application's data in transit is secure, using certificates either provided by Azure or brought in from external sources. Remember, when dealing with custom domains, the certificate must meet specific criteria for TLS/SSL bindings.

### Creating a Free Managed Certificate

**App Service Plan Requirements:**
- Your App Service plan must be at least in the **Basic** tier (Standard, Premium, or Isolated also work).

**Steps to Create a Free Managed Certificate:**

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - **Custom DNS Configuration**: Ensure your custom domain is correctly set up with Azure App Service.
   - **CAA Record**: For some domains, you'll need to add a CAA record to allow DigiCert to issue certificates:
     ```plaintext
     0 issue digicert.com
     ```

2. **Certificate Management**:
   - Azure App Service will handle:
     - Certificate issuance by DigiCert.
     - Automatic renewal every six months, 45 days before expiration.

3. **Limitations**:
   - **No Wildcard Certificates**: You cannot use this for wildcard domains like `*.example.com`.
   - **Not for Client Certificates**: Cannot be used with client certificate authentication by thumbprint.
   - **No Private DNS**: Does not work with private DNS zones.
   - **Non-Exportable**: These certificates are managed by Azure and cannot be exported.
   - **ASE Incompatible**: Not supported in App Service Environment.
   - **Character Restrictions**: Only supports alphanumeric characters, dashes (-), and periods (.), with a maximum length of 64 characters for the domain name.

**Key Considerations:**
- **Avoid Certificate Pinning**: Since Azure manages these certificates, the root issuer or other aspects might change, so don't pin to specific certificate details.

This solution provides an effortless way to secure your custom domain in Azure App Service, but be mindful of its limitations, especially if you require more advanced certificate management features.

### Importing an App Service Certificate

**Azure Management for Purchased App Service Certificates:**

- **Purchase**: Azure handles the procurement from the certificate provider.
- **Verification**: Automatically verifies the domain for the certificate.
- **Storage**: Stores the certificate in **Azure Key Vault**.
- **Renewal**: Manages the renewal process.
- **Synchronization**: Automatically updates or synchronizes the certificate across your App Service apps.

**Actions with an Existing App Service Certificate:**

- **Import**: You can import your App Service Certificate into Azure App Service:
  ```plaintext
  # Example command to import a certificate:
  # az webapp config ssl import --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --certificate-name <certificate-name> --key-vault <key-vault-name> --key-vault-certificate-name <vault-certificate-name>
  ```

- **Management**:
  - **Renew**: Extend the validity of your certificate.
  - **Rekey**: Generate a new key pair for the certificate, useful if you suspect key compromise.
  - **Export**: Export the certificate for use elsewhere if needed, although direct export from Azure might not be straightforward, you can download it from Key Vault.

**Important Note:**
- **Azure National Clouds**: App Service Certificates are **not supported** in these environments.

This functionality provides a straightforward method for managing SSL/TLS certificates within Azure, simplifying the process of securing your web applications with minimal manual intervention after the initial setup.
