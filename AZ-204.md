  - **Documentation:**[App Service GitHub login](link to doc)

Each provider's endpoint is used for user authentication and token validation.

#### **How Authentication and Authorization Works**

- **Module Execution:** 
  - The authentication module operates in the same sandbox as your application for Windows, but in a separate container for Linux and custom containers.

- **Request Handling:**
  - **Authentication:** Handles user and client authentication with the specified identity provider.
  - **Token Management:** Validates, stores, and refreshes OAuth tokens.
  - **Session Management:** Manages the authenticated session state.
  - **Header Injection:** Injects identity information into HTTP headers.

- **Configuration:**
  - Can be set up via Azure Resource Manager settings or a configuration file, without requiring SDKs or code changes.

- **Platform Independence:**
  - This system is language-agnostic, meaning you don't need to modify your application's code to utilize the authentication features.

**Note for Linux and Containers:**
  - Authentication runs in a separate, isolated container, which means there's no direct in-process integration with language frameworks.

#### **Example Configuration via Azure CLI:**

To enable authentication for an app with Microsoft Entra ID:

```bash
az webapp auth update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> \
  --enabled true --action AllowAnonymous \
  --aad-client-id <client-id> --aad-client-secret <client-secret> \
  --aad-issuer-url <issuer-url>
```

#### **Key Points:**

- **Multiple Providers:** You can configure multiple sign-in options for users.
- **No Code Changes:** Authentication can be enabled without altering your application's codebase.
- **Security Features:** 
  - Token management ensures secure and efficient handling of OAuth tokens.

#### **Conclusion:**

Azure App Service's authentication and authorization capabilities simplify securing your applications by offloading the complexities of identity management to trusted providers. This integration allows for a seamless setup where your application remains focused on its core functionality while the platform handles user identity and security.

### **Authentication Flow in Azure App Service**

#### **Overview:**

- **Provider SDK Usage:** The flow varies based on whether the application uses the identity provider's SDK or relies on App Service for authentication.

#### **Authentication Flow Steps:**

- **Without Provider SDK (Server-Directed Flow):**
  1. **Sign User In:**
     - Redirects to `/.auth/login/<provider>`.

  2. **Post-Authentication:**
     - Provider redirects back to `/.auth/login/<provider>/callback`.

  3. **Establish Authenticated Session:**
     - App Service adds an authenticated cookie to the response.

  4. **Serve Authenticated Content:**
     - Client includes the authentication cookie in subsequent requests (handled by the browser).

- **With Provider SDK (Client-Directed Flow):**
  1. **Sign User In:**
     - Client code uses the provider's SDK to authenticate and receive a token.
     - See provider's documentation for specifics.

  2. **Post-Authentication:**
     - Client code sends the token to `/.auth/login/<provider>` for validation.

  3. **Establish Authenticated Session:**
     - App Service returns its authentication token.

  4. **Serve Authenticated Content:**
     - Client presents the token in the `X-ZUMO-AUTH` header (handled by Mobile Apps client SDKs).

**Note:** For browser clients, App Service can automatically redirect unauthenticated users to `/.auth/login/<provider>`.

#### **Authorization Behavior Configuration:**

- **Allow Unauthenticated Requests:**
  - Authentication is deferred to your application code.
  - Authenticated requests include authentication info in headers.
  - Useful for presenting multiple sign-in options or handling anonymous requests.

- **Require Authentication:**
  - Rejects unauthenticated traffic:
    - **Redirect:** Sends the user to `/.auth/login/<provider>`.
    - **HTTP 401 Unauthorized:** For native mobile apps or when configured to return unauthorized.
    - **HTTP 403 Forbidden:** Can be set as the rejection response.

**Caution:** 
  - Requiring authentication for all calls might not be suitable for apps with public pages, like single-page applications.

#### **Configuration via Azure Portal:**

- **Authentication Settings:**
  - Navigate to your App Service in the Azure portal.
  - Go to **Authentication / Authorization** under **Settings**.
  - **Toggle Authentication:** On.
  - **Choose Action:** Select how to handle unauthenticated requests (Allow or Require).

#### **Example Configuration via Azure CLI:**

To configure App Service to require authentication with redirection:

```bash
az webapp auth update --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> \
  --enabled true --action LoginWithMicrosoftAccount
```

#### **Conclusion:**

Azure App Service provides a flexible authentication framework that can operate with or without direct integration with provider SDKs. The choice between server-directed and client-directed flows depends on your application's nature and interaction with users. The authorization settings allow you to control access to your application, balancing between security and user experience.

    az webapp config hostname add --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --hostname <custom-domain>
    ```

  - **Access Restrictions:**
    - Restricts access to your app based on IP addresses.
    ```bash
    # Add an IP restriction
    az webapp config access-restriction add --resource-group <resource-group-name> --name <app-name> --rule-name "AllowSpecificIP" --action Allow --ip-address <ip-address>
    ```

  - **Service Endpoints:**
    - Allows secure access to Azure services like Azure Storage from your app.

  - **Private Endpoints:**
    - Connects your app privately to Azure services or on-premises networks without internet exposure.

  **Outbound Traffic Control:**
  - **Hybrid Connections:**
    - Enables connectivity to on-premises systems securely.
    ```bash
    # Create a Hybrid Connection endpoint
    az relay hybrid-connection create --resource-group <resource-group-name> --namespace-name <namespace-name> --name <hybrid-connection-name> --type HybridConnection
    ```

  - **Gateway-required Virtual Network Integration:**
    - Allows your app to connect to resources in a virtual network via an Azure Application Gateway or a VPN Gateway.

  - **Virtual Network Integration:**
    - Enables your app to access resources within an Azure VNet.

#### **Inbound Use Cases:**

- **SSL Certificate Binding:**
  - **Feature:** App-assigned address for IP-based SSL.

- **Dedicated Inbound Address:**
  - **Feature:** App-assigned address to provide a unique inbound IP.

- **IP Whitelisting:**
  - **Feature:** Access restrictions to allow access only from specific IP addresses.

#### **Notes:**

- **Feature Compatibility:** Mixing features is possible, but there are limitations due to the nature of the multi-tenant environment.
- **Security:** By using these features, you can significantly enhance the security of your applications by controlling who can access them and how they communicate outward.

#### **Conclusion:**

Azure App Service networking features offer a robust set of tools for controlling both inbound and outbound traffic. These features allow developers to tailor network behavior to specific application requirements, ensuring both security and connectivity needs are met without compromising on performance or user experience.

### **Default Networking Behavior in Azure App Service**

#### **Overview:**

- **Scale Units:** Azure App Service runs on scale units that serve multiple customers.

- **VM Types:**
  - **Free, Shared, Basic, Standard, Premium:** Share similar worker VM types.
  - **PremiumV2:** Uses a different VM type.
  - **PremiumV3:** Uses yet another VM type.

#### **Outbound Addresses:**

- **Worker VMs and Outbound IPs:**
  - Apps share outbound IP addresses based on the VM family they run on.
  - Changing to a different VM family (like moving to PremiumV2 or PremiumV3) changes the set of outbound IPs.

- **Address Sharing:**
  - The outbound addresses are used by all apps on the same worker VM family within an App Service deployment.

#### **Finding Outbound IP Information:**

- **Azure Portal:**
  - Navigate to your app in the Azure portal.
  - Go to **Properties** in the left-hand navigation to view current outbound IP addresses.

- **Azure CLI Commands:**

  **Current Outbound IP Addresses:**
  ```bash
  az webapp show \
      --resource-group <group_name> \
      --name <app-name> \
      --query outboundIpAddresses \
      --output tsv
  ```

  **Possible Outbound IP Addresses (for all tiers):**
  ```bash
  az webapp show \
      --resource-group <group_name> \
      --name <app-name> \
      --query possibleOutboundIpAddresses \
      --output tsv
  ```

#### **Notes:**

- **Scaling:** When scaling out, all apps in the same App Service plan are replicated across new instances, but they will share the same set of outbound IPs unless you change VM families.

- **Predictability:** Knowing the possible outbound IPs is useful for firewall rules or when integrating with services that require IP whitelisting.

- **Multi-Tenant Implications:** In multi-tenant environments (Free and Shared), your app might share an outbound IP with other customers' apps, which might not be ideal for some scenarios.

#### **Conclusion:**

Understanding and managing outbound IP addresses in Azure App Service is crucial for applications that need to communicate externally or integrate with services that whitelist IPs. The ability to scale while maintaining or managing these addresses allows for flexible deployment strategies tailored to security and connectivity needs.

### **Exercise: Create a Static HTML Web App Using Azure Cloud Shell**

#### **Prerequisites:**

- **Account Verification:** Use the free Azure sandbox which allows resource creation in specific regions.

#### **Step-by-Step Guide:**

1. **Switch to Classic Cloud Shell:**
   - After loading the Cloud Shell, go to **Settings** and select **Go to Classic version**.

2. **Download the Sample App:**

   - Create and navigate to a new directory:
     ```bash
     mkdir htmlapp
     cd htmlapp
     ```

   - Clone the sample repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/Azure-Samples/html-docs-hello-world.git
     ```

   - Set up variables for resource group and app name:
     ```bash
     resourceGroup=$(az group list --query "[].{id:name}" -o tsv)
     appName=az204app$RANDOM
     ```

3. **Create the Web App:**

   - Change to the sample code directory:
     ```bash
     cd html-docs-hello-world
     ```

   - Deploy the app using the `az webapp up` command:
     ```bash
     az webapp up -g $resourceGroup -n $appName --html
     ```

   - This command will:
     - Create a resource group if needed.
     - Create an App Service plan.
     - Create a web app.
     - Deploy files from the current directory.

   - Note the `app_url` from the output to verify your app in a browser.

4. **Verify Deployment:**

   - Open the app URL in a new browser tab to ensure the site is up and running.

5. **Update and Redeploy the App:**

   - Edit the HTML file:
     ```bash
     code index.html
     ```
     - Modify the `<h1>` tag content.
     - Use `Ctrl+S` to save, then `Ctrl+Q` to exit.

   - Redeploy the updated app:
     ```bash
     az webapp up -g $resourceGroup -n $appName --html
     ```
     - You can recall this command using the up-arrow key.

   - Refresh the browser tab to see your changes.

#### **Notes:**

- **Region:** Ensure to select one of the available regions for your sandbox deployment.

- **Command Utility:** The `az webapp up` command simplifies the deployment process by handling several steps automatically.

- **Environment:** This exercise assumes you're working in a Cloud Shell environment, where you don't need to install the Azure CLI locally.

#### **Conclusion:**

This exercise demonstrates how to quickly set up, deploy, and update a static HTML site using Azure App Service and Azure CLI commands in the Cloud Shell. It's an excellent way to get started with Azure web services, showcasing the ease of deployment and the power of Azure's command-line tools for managing applications.
