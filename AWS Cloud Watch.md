To create a serverless API backend using Lambda applications:

- In the AWS Console, search for **Lambda**.
- Navigate to **Applications** from the left-hand navigation bar.
- Click **Create Application**, and choose **Serverless API Backend**.
  
This will automatically create an API Gateway, a DynamoDB table, and Lambda Functions for our API. Follow these steps:

1. **Name the Application**:  
   Set the application name as `cloudwatchcourseapi`.
   
2. **Choose the Runtime**:  
   Select **Node.js** as the runtime environment.

3. **Source Control**:  
   Use **CodeCommit** for the repository, leaving the default name `cloudwatchcourseapi`.

4. **Set Permissions**:  
   Enable permissions by selecting **Create roles and permissions boundary**.

5. **Create the Application**:  
   Click **Create** to initialize the application.

### 2. **Generating Logs with API Requests**

Once the application is created, make requests to the API endpoint to generate logs for CloudWatch.

- Find the **API Endpoint** generated in the AWS Console.
- Copy the endpoint URL for use in the next step.

### 3. **Configuring the Sample Application**

A sample Node.js application is prepared to send requests to the API, generating logs in CloudWatch.

#### Steps to Run the Application:

1. **Open Visual Studio Code**:
   - Navigate to your project directory.
   - Open the terminal, and type:
     ```bash
     code .
     ```

2. **Install Node Packages**:
   - Navigate to the `api` folder and open the integrated terminal.
   - Run the following command to install dependencies:
     ```bash
     npm install
     ```

3. **Update API Endpoint**:
   - Open the `.env` file in the `api` folder.
   - Replace the placeholder `API_ENDPOINT` with the actual API endpoint URL from AWS.

4. **Run the Application**:
   - To start the application, run:
     ```bash
     node server.js
     ```
   - The app will run on **localhost:8080**.

### 4. **Simulating API Requests**

The sample application will send a series of API requests, generating logs for CloudWatch.

- Define the number of requests you want to make (e.g., 100).
- By default, every third request will fail, creating error logs in CloudWatch for investigation.

#### Example of Simulated API Requests:
```javascript
// Simulate API requests
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  fetch(API_ENDPOINT)
    .then(response => console.log(`Request ${i}: Success`))
    .catch(error => console.log(`Request ${i}: Failed`));
}
```

If you want to simulate only failed requests, check the "All requests fail" option in the UI of the demo app.

### 5. **Generating Metrics in CloudWatch**

Let the application run for several minutes to generate sufficient logs and metrics. You can configure the app to send a large number of requests (e.g., 1,000 or 10,000) for more comprehensive metrics in CloudWatch.

```bash
// Initiate multiple requests
node server.js
```

After generating the logs, proceed to the AWS CloudWatch console to analyze the metrics and logs for further insights.

### Conclusion

By following these steps, you set up a serverless API that generates logs and metrics for AWS CloudWatch. This environment provides valuable insights into the performance and health of your cloud applications, allowing you to monitor and troubleshoot effectively.

## Exploring CloudWatch Metrics

### What Are Metrics in CloudWatch?
Metrics in AWS CloudWatch represent a set of time-ordered data points that can be monitored. For example, when we make API requests, these activities are converted into metrics that CloudWatch tracks. Each metric is stored in a namespace, which helps in organizing them for various services.

### Navigating to CloudWatch Metrics

1. **Accessing CloudWatch**:  
   Go to your AWS console, type "CloudWatch" in the search bar, and open the CloudWatch service.

2. **Viewing Metrics**:  
   - On the left menu, expand **Metrics** and click **All metrics**.
   - Metrics are organized in **Namespaces**. You will see AWS namespaces and custom namespaces.
   - For our demo, we created a Lambda application with an API Gateway, Lambda functions, and DynamoDB.

### Viewing API Gateway Metrics

1. **API Gateway Metrics**:  
   - Open the **ApiGateway** namespace, and select **By API Name**.
   - Select the metrics for our application (`cloudwatchcourseapi`).
   - These metrics can then be added to the graph.

2. **Graphed Metrics**:  
   - After selecting the metrics, navigate to **Graphed metrics**.  
   - The data is initially grouped by a period of five minutes. You can hover over points to see details like latency.
   - To adjust the time granularity, change the period from five minutes to one second for more detailed insights. 
   
   ```python
   # Example of adjusting latency granularity
   metric_period = 1  # seconds
   ```

### Viewing Lambda Metrics

1. **Lambda Function Metrics**:  
   - Go back to **Browse** under namespaces and select the **Lambda** namespace.
   - Navigate **By Function Name** and find the Lambda function called `putItemFunction` that was invoked by our API Gateway.

2. **Viewing Invocations and Errors**:  
   - Select both **Invocations** and **Errors** metrics.
   - In the **Graphed metrics**, you will now see performance data for the function.

   ```bash
   # Example of Lambda invocation monitoring
   cloudwatch.get_metric_statistics(
       Namespace='AWS/Lambda',
       MetricName='Invocations',
       Dimensions=[
           {
               'Name': 'FunctionName',
               'Value': 'putItemFunction'
           },
       ],
       StartTime=start_time,
       EndTime=end_time,
       Period=60,
       Statistics=['Sum']
   )
   ```

3. **Error Analysis**:  
   - The metrics might display an error rate, such as 0.33, which is an average over five minutes.  
   - You can change the **statistic** from "average" to "sum" to see the total number of errors in a given time period.

   ```bash
   # Example for switching from average to sum in error metrics
   cloudwatch.get_metric_statistics(
       Namespace='AWS/Lambda',
       MetricName='Errors',
       Statistics=['Sum'],
       Period=300
   )
   ```

### Conclusion

AWS CloudWatch provides an intuitive interface to explore, monitor, and visualize metrics. You can analyze various aspects like latency, invocation errors, and overall performance of your APIs and Lambda functions. By switching between different statistics like average and sum, you gain a clearer understanding of your application's behavior and can fine-tune resources accordingly.

## Working with Custom Metrics in AWS CloudWatch

### Importance of Custom Metrics
While AWS CloudWatch offers a variety of built-in metrics that provide valuable insights into service health, there are instances where businesses need more specific data. Custom metrics allow businesses to monitor unique business-critical data points, which aren't covered by standard metrics. By incorporating custom metrics, businesses can achieve more tailored monitoring that aligns with their specific objectives.

### Publishing Custom Metrics

Custom metrics can be pushed into CloudWatch using either the **AWS CLI** or the **CloudWatch API**. Once these metrics are available, they can be analyzed just like the built-in ones.

### Types of Metrics in AWS

- **Standard Resolution Metrics**: Have a data granularity of one minute and are the default type for AWS services.
  
- **High Resolution Metrics**: Have a data granularity of one second, useful for scenarios that require more fine-tuned monitoring. Although high-resolution metrics may not always be necessary, they can offer greater detail for certain business metrics.

### Custom Metric Example Using AWS CLI

```bash
aws cloudwatch put-metric-data \
  --namespace "CustomNamespace" \
  --metric-name "BusinessMetric" \
  --dimensions "InstanceId=i-1234567890abcdef0" \
  --value 23.5 \
  --unit "Milliseconds"
```

- **Namespace**: Custom metrics are grouped under a specific namespace.
- **Metric Name**: The name of the custom metric, e.g., `BusinessMetric`.
- **Dimensions**: Optional key-value pairs that help categorize the metric (e.g., by instance ID).
- **Value**: The data point value for the metric.
- **Unit**: Specifies the unit of the metric, such as seconds, bytes, or milliseconds.

### Conclusion

By using custom metrics in AWS CloudWatch, businesses can extend monitoring beyond built-in services, gaining more tailored insights that align with their specific needs. Whether using standard or high-resolution metrics, this customization can significantly enhance operational efficiency and provide a competitive advantage.

## Collecting Custom Metrics in AWS CloudWatch

### Overview
Custom metrics allow businesses to gather specific data about their applications and push it to AWS CloudWatch. This enables detailed monitoring and analysis, tailored to business needs. In this demo, we integrate custom metrics into an application, utilizing the AWS SDK and publishing metrics via the API.

### Step-by-Step Process

#### 1. Add Dependencies
First, install the required AWS SDK packages:
```bash
npm install @aws-sdk/client-cloudwatch @aws-sdk/config-resolver
```

#### 2. Setting up IAM Permissions
To push custom metrics, you need to create a user with the necessary permissions:

- Navigate to the **IAM Console** and create a new user.
- Create a custom policy for the **CloudWatch** service with the `PutMetricData` permission:
  ```json
  {
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
      {
        "Effect": "Allow",
        "Action": "cloudwatch:PutMetricData",
        "Resource": "*"
      }
    ]
  }
  ```
- Attach this policy to the user you create (e.g., `pushcustommetrics`).
- Generate an access key and secret key for the user.

#### 3. Configure Environment Variables
In your application's `.env` file, provide the following values:
```bash
AWS_REGION=us-east-1
ACCESS_KEY_ID=<your-access-key>
SECRET_ACCESS_KEY=<your-secret-key>
```

#### 4. Publish Custom Metrics

Create a file `cloudwatchMetrics.js` to handle metric publishing. This will define the parameters and make the API call to CloudWatch.

```javascript
const { CloudWatchClient, PutMetricDataCommand } = require("@aws-sdk/client-cloudwatch");

// Initialize CloudWatch client
const cloudwatchClient = new CloudWatchClient({
    region: process.env.AWS_REGION,
    credentials: {
        accessKeyId: process.env.ACCESS_KEY_ID,
        secretAccessKey: process.env.SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
    }
});

// Function to publish a custom metric
const publishMetric = async (metricName, value, dimensions = []) => {
    const params = {
        MetricData: [
            {
                MetricName: metricName,
                Dimensions: dimensions,
                Timestamp: new Date(),
                Value: value,
                Unit: "Milliseconds"
            }
        ],
        Namespace: "CloudWatchApiCourse/Performance"
    };

    try {
        const command = new PutMetricDataCommand(params);
        await cloudwatchClient.send(command);
        console.log("Successfully published metric to CloudWatch");
    } catch (error) {
        console.error("Error publishing metric:", error);
    }
};

module.exports = { publishMetric };
```

#### 5. Use Custom Metrics in Your Application

Within your server logic, integrate the metric-publishing function to capture custom data such as **response time**.

```javascript
const { publishMetric } = require("./cloudwatchMetrics");

const startTime = new Date();
// Simulate API call
const endTime = new Date();
const responseTime = endTime - startTime;

// Specify dimensions (e.g., environment, endpoint)
const dimensions = [
    { Name: "Environment", Value: "Production" },
    { Name: "Endpoint", Value: "/api" },
    { Name: "HttpMethod", Value: "GET" }
];

// Publish custom metric
publishMetric("ResponseTime", responseTime, dimensions);
```

#### 6. Running the Application
Start your server:
```bash
node server.js
```

When requests are made, the custom metric data will be published to CloudWatch. Successful operations will log:
```
Successfully published metric to CloudWatch
```

#### 7. Viewing Metrics in CloudWatch

- Go to the **CloudWatch Console** and navigate to **All Metrics**.
- Look for the namespace you defined, e.g., `CloudWatchApiCourse/Performance`.
- You will find the custom metric (`ResponseTime`) along with dimensions such as `Environment`, `Endpoint`, and `HttpMethod`.

#### 8. Visualizing Metrics
- Select the metric and view it in **Graphed Metrics**.
- Change the time granularity to **5 seconds** for more precise monitoring.
- You can switch from average to sum for a cumulative view.

### Conclusion
Using custom metrics allows businesses to collect specific data points that are critical for decision-making and operational efficiency. By integrating custom metrics into CloudWatch, you can visualize and monitor the performance of key aspects of your application.

# Streaming Metrics in AWS CloudWatch

CloudWatch provides businesses with insights into various aspects of their infrastructure, but metrics can be used for more than just monitoring. **Streaming metrics** enables businesses to stream data to different AWS services for further processing and analysis, unlocking deeper insights and facilitating data-driven decisions.

## Setting Up a Metric Stream

To set up metric streaming in CloudWatch:

1. **Navigate to Metrics Stream**:
   - Under the Metrics tab, select **Streams** and create a new metric stream.
  
2. **Choose Metrics to Stream**:
   - You can either stream metrics from individual namespaces or select all namespaces.
   - Exclusions are possible if you want to stream all except specific namespaces.

### Code Snippet Example:
```bash
aws cloudwatch put-metric-stream --name "streamdemo" --output-format "json"
```

## Configuration of Metric Stream

After selecting metrics, you need to configure the destination of your metrics stream:

- **Quick S3 Setup**: 
  - Automatically creates an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose and sends the data to an S3 bucket.

- **Using Existing Firehose**:
  - You can choose an existing Kinesis Data Firehose or set up a new one. The source has to be set to **Direct PUT** to allow CloudWatch to push the data.

### Configuration Example:
```bash
aws firehose create-delivery-stream \
  --delivery-stream-name streamdemo \
  --delivery-stream-type DirectPut \
  --s3-destination-configuration file://s3-config.json
```

## Destinations for Metric Streams

You can send your metrics to various AWS services, including:
- **Amazon S3**: To store data.
- **Amazon Redshift**: For data warehousing.
- **HTTP Endpoints**: To integrate with third-party services like MongoDB, Logz.io, etc.

## Verifying the Metric Stream

Once your stream is configured, initiate traffic to your application to generate metrics:

1. Generate test traffic (e.g., 100 requests).
2. Monitor the stream in the **Kinesis Data Firehose** section.

   - **Monitoring Metrics**:
     - You can view details such as incoming bytes, put requests, and data delivery status to S3.

3. Once active, data will appear in your destination (e.g., S3 bucket) after a short delay for batching and processing.

### Traffic Generation Example:
```bash
for i in {1..100}; do curl http://your-application-endpoint; done
```

## Finalizing the Process

- After a few minutes, you can verify that the data is successfully streamed to your S3 bucket by navigating to **Amazon Kinesis Firehose** > **Delivery Stream** > **Monitoring** and checking the incoming records.

### Verifying Data in S3:
```bash
aws s3 ls s3://metrics-streams-streamdemo
```

---

This setup allows organizations to leverage CloudWatch streaming for customizable and actionable business insights, providing flexibility in choosing destinations and maximizing the value of their data.
