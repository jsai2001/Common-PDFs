Based on your resume and the role of "Java Spring Boot Senior Developer," the interviewer will likely focus on your experience with Java, Spring Boot, and related technologies, as well as your ability to apply these skills in a senior-level capacity. While your resume highlights strong expertise in DevOps, cloud technologies, and automation, the role seems to emphasize Java and Spring Boot development. Below are the key topics you should prepare for by tomorrow, tailored to align your existing skills with the expectations of a Senior Java Spring Boot Developer:

---

### Core Topics to Prepare
1. **Java Fundamentals and Advanced Concepts**
   - **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP):** Be ready to discuss encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, and abstraction with examples from your experience.
   - **Collections Framework:** Understand Lists, Sets, Maps, and their implementations (e.g., ArrayList, HashMap). Be prepared for questions on performance and use cases.
   - **Exception Handling:** Explain try-catch, custom exceptions, and best practices.
   - **Multithreading and Concurrency:** Familiarize yourself with Threads, Executors, and the `java.util.concurrent` package (e.g., ThreadPool, CompletableFuture).
   - **Java 8+ Features:** Focus on Lambda Expressions, Streams API, Optional, and Functional Interfaces—key features often used in Spring Boot applications.

2. **Spring Boot Essentials**
   - **Spring Core:** Understand Dependency Injection (DI), Inversion of Control (IoC), and Bean lifecycle.
   - **Spring Boot Basics:** Be able to explain auto-configuration, starters, and how Spring Boot simplifies development.
   - **RESTful APIs:** Design and implementation of REST endpoints (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) using `@RestController`, `@RequestMapping`, etc.
   - **Data Access:** Knowledge of Spring Data JPA, Hibernate, and database interactions (e.g., connecting to MySQL, as in your project).
   - **Spring MVC:** Understand the MVC pattern, controllers, services, and how Spring Boot leverages it.
   - **Configuration Management:** Use of `@Configuration`, `@Bean`, and `application.properties`/`application.yml` files.

3. **Senior-Level Expectations**
   - **System Design:** Be prepared to discuss how you’d architect a Spring Boot application (e.g., microservices vs. monolith, scalability considerations).
   - **Code Quality:** Best practices like writing clean, maintainable code, unit testing (e.g., JUnit, Mockito), and integration testing.
   - **Performance Optimization:** Experience optimizing Java/Spring Boot applications (e.g., caching with Spring Cache, lazy loading in JPA).
   - **Leadership:** Since it’s a senior role, expect questions on mentoring (you’ve mentored juniors at NielsenIQ) and driving technical decisions.

4. **DevOps and Cloud Integration (Your Strength)**
   - **CI/CD with Spring Boot:** Leverage your Jenkins, GitHub Actions, and Maven experience to explain how you’d integrate a Spring Boot app into a CI/CD pipeline.
   - **Docker and Kubernetes:** Discuss containerizing Spring Boot apps (tie this to your personal project and NielsenIQ experience).
   - **AWS Integration:** Explain how you’d deploy a Spring Boot app on AWS (e.g., EC2, EKS, RDS, S3) using Terraform or Ansible, as mentioned in your resume.
   - **Monitoring:** Use your CloudWatch experience to discuss monitoring Spring Boot apps (e.g., custom metrics, Actuator endpoints).

5. **Database and SQL**
   - **JPA/Hibernate:** Be ready to explain entity mapping, relationships (e.g., @OneToMany), and JPQL queries.
   - **SQL Optimization:** Tie this to your Snowflake SQL experience—discuss optimizing complex queries and window functions.
   - **MySQL:** Since your personal project uses MySQL, prepare to discuss schema design and integration with Spring Boot.

6. **Microservices (Likely for Senior Role)**
   - **Spring Boot Microservices:** Basics of building microservices (e.g., `@EnableEurekaClient`, Spring Cloud Config).
   - **API Gateway:** Concepts like routing and load balancing (e.g., Spring Cloud Gateway).
   - **Inter-service Communication:** REST, messaging (e.g., Kafka, RabbitMQ), and resilience patterns (e.g., Circuit Breaker with Resilience4j).

7. **Your Projects**
   - **Containerized Doctor-Patient System:** Be ready to explain the architecture, why you chose Docker, and how you’d refactor it with Spring Boot and Java instead of PHP.
   - **NielsenIQ CI/CD and Data Systems:** Highlight Java-related automation (e.g., Python scripts could be reframed as Java utilities) and tie them to Spring Boot deployment workflows.

---

### Specific Preparation Tips
- **Brush Up on Java:** Your resume mentions Java and C++ but focuses more on Python/Shell. Revisit Java syntax, Spring Boot annotations, and coding examples (e.g., a simple REST API).
- **Spring Boot Hands-On:** If possible, create a quick Spring Boot project (e.g., a CRUD app with JPA and REST) to refresh your memory. Use tools like Spring Initializr.
- **Tie DevOps to Development:** Emphasize how your DevOps skills (CI/CD, Docker, AWS) enhance your ability to deliver robust Spring Boot applications.
- **Behavioral Questions:** Prepare examples of mentoring, solving complex problems, and optimizing systems (e.g., 30% performance boost at NielsenIQ).
- **Mock Questions:**
  - "Design a REST API for a booking system using Spring Boot."
  - "How would you optimize a slow-performing Spring Boot app?"
  - "Explain how you’d deploy a Spring Boot microservice on AWS."

### Final Notes
Given your strong DevOps and cloud background, you’re well-positioned to shine in areas like deployment, scalability, and system optimization—key for a senior role. However, since the job is Java Spring Boot-focused, prioritize refreshing your Java and Spring Boot knowledge tonight. Use your existing experience to bridge any gaps (e.g., “While I’ve heavily used Python for automation, I’ve applied similar principles in Java for system-level tasks”). Good luck tomorrow!
