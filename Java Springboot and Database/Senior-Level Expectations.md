### System Design

#### General Architecture
1. **How would you architect a Spring Boot application for a high-traffic e-commerce platform? Would you choose a monolithic or microservices approach, and why?**
   - **Answer:** For a high-traffic e-commerce platform, I’d lean toward a microservices architecture using Spring Boot due to its scalability and modularity. I’d design services like `ProductService`, `OrderService`, and `UserService`, each with its own Spring Boot app, database (e.g., RDS), and REST APIs. This allows independent scaling—e.g., `OrderService` can scale during checkout spikes. At NielsenIQ, I managed Kubernetes for similar scalability, reducing deployment misalignments by 30%. However, if the platform is in early stages, I’d start with a monolith for simplicity, using Spring Boot’s MVC pattern, and refactor later based on traffic needs.
   - **Why Microservices:** My AWS and Kubernetes experience supports this—microservices align with containerized deployments and horizontal scaling.

2. **What factors do you consider when deciding between a monolith and microservices for a Spring Boot project?**
   - **Answer:** I consider team size, traffic volume, deployment frequency, and complexity. A monolith suits small teams or simple apps due to easier debugging and deployment—as I did with my Doctor-Patient system using Docker. Microservices are better for large teams, high traffic, or when independent scaling is needed, like at NielsenIQ where I optimized CI/CD for distributed systems. I’d also weigh operational overhead—microservices require more DevOps effort, which I’m equipped to handle with Terraform and Ansible.

3. **Can you walk us through the design of a scalable Spring Boot application you’ve worked on?**
   - **Answer:** While my NielsenIQ work was DevOps-focused, I can adapt it to Spring Boot. Imagine a Spring Boot app I’d design for NielsenIQ’s data aggregation: a REST API layer (`@RestController`) for client requests, a service layer (`@Service`) for business logic, and Spring Data JPA for Snowflake SQL integration. I’d deploy it on AWS EKS with Docker, using my 20% provisioning time reduction experience with Terraform. Autoscaling via Kubernetes and CloudWatch monitoring (custom metrics from my resume) would ensure scalability.

4. **How do you ensure loose coupling and high cohesion in a Spring Boot application?**
   - **Answer:** I use Dependency Injection (`@Autowired`) to decouple components, define clear interfaces for services, and keep each Spring Boot module focused on a single responsibility—high cohesion. In my Doctor-Patient project, I separated UI, logic, and data layers, a principle I’d apply in Spring Boot with packages like `controller`, `service`, and `repository`.

#### Microservices
5. **How would you break down a monolithic Spring Boot application into microservices? What challenges might arise?**
   - **Answer:** I’d identify bounded contexts—e.g., in an e-commerce app, split into `Catalog`, `Orders`, and `Payments`. Each becomes a Spring Boot microservice with its own database and REST API. I’d use Spring Cloud Config for centralized configuration and Eureka for service discovery. Challenges include data consistency (solved with eventual consistency or Saga patterns) and increased latency (mitigated with async messaging like Kafka). My Kubernetes experience at NielsenIQ helps manage these deployments.

6. **What Spring Cloud components would you use to implement a microservices architecture, and why?**
   - **Answer:** I’d use Spring Cloud Config for externalized configuration, Eureka for service discovery, Spring Cloud Gateway for routing, and Resilience4j for fault tolerance. These align with my AWS and Kubernetes skills—e.g., Gateway replaces manual load balancing I did at NielsenIQ, reducing misalignments by 30%.

7. **How do you handle service discovery and load balancing in a Spring Boot microservices setup?**
   - **Answer:** I’d use Netflix Eureka for service discovery—each Spring Boot service registers with Eureka, and clients query it for endpoints. For load balancing, Spring Cloud LoadBalancer or Kubernetes’ built-in balancing works, based on my EKS experience at NielsenIQ. This ensures even traffic distribution.

8. **How would you design inter-service communication in a Spring Boot microservices ecosystem (e.g., REST vs. messaging)?**
   - **Answer:** For synchronous needs (e.g., order validation), I’d use REST with Spring Boot’s `RestTemplate` or `WebClient`. For asynchronous tasks (e.g., order notifications), I’d use Spring Kafka or RabbitMQ. My Python automation at NielsenIQ used similar async patterns, boosting performance by 30%.

9. **Explain how you’d implement a Circuit Breaker pattern in a Spring Boot microservice. Have you used Resilience4j or Hystrix?**
   - **Answer:** I’d use Resilience4j with Spring Boot. If `OrderService` calls `PaymentService` and it fails, Resilience4j opens the circuit to prevent cascading failures, falling back to a default response. I haven’t used it directly, but my fault-tolerant Docker setups at NielsenIQ align with this concept.
   - **Code Snippet:**
     ```java
     @RestController
     public class OrderController {
         @Autowired
         private PaymentClient paymentClient;

         @GetMapping("/order/{id}")
         @CircuitBreaker(name = "paymentService", fallbackMethod = "paymentFallback")
         public ResponseEntity<String> getOrder(@PathVariable String id) {
             return ResponseEntity.ok(paymentClient.processPayment(id));
         }

         public ResponseEntity<String> paymentFallback(String id, Exception ex) {
             return ResponseEntity.ok("Payment unavailable, try later");
         }
     }
     ```

#### Scalability and Resilience
10. **How do you design a Spring Boot application to handle 10,000 concurrent users?**
    - **Answer:** I’d use a stateless Spring Boot app with horizontal scaling on AWS EKS, as I did at NielsenIQ. Load balancing via Spring Cloud Gateway, caching with Redis (Spring Cache), and async processing with `@Async` would handle concurrency. My CloudWatch monitoring experience ensures I’d track performance.

11. **What strategies would you use to make a Spring Boot application horizontally scalable on AWS?**
    - **Answer:** I’d containerize the Spring Boot app with Docker, deploy it on EKS with auto-scaling groups (like my 20% provisioning reduction with Terraform), and use RDS for the database with read replicas. My NielsenIQ experience with AWS optimizes this setup.

12. **How do you ensure fault tolerance in a distributed Spring Boot system?**
    - **Answer:** I’d implement retries with Spring Retry, circuit breakers with Resilience4j, and fallback methods. Kubernetes health checks and my CloudWatch custom alarms from NielsenIQ would ensure quick recovery from failures.

13. **How would you handle database scalability in a Spring Boot application with millions of records?**
    - **Answer:** I’d use Spring Data JPA with sharding or partitioning for writes, read replicas for queries, and caching (Redis) for frequent reads. My Snowflake SQL optimization (45% accuracy boost) informs this approach.

#### Real-World Scenarios
14. **Design a RESTful API for a doctor-patient appointment system using Spring Boot.**
    - **Answer:** I’d design endpoints like `POST /appointments` to book, `GET /doctors/{id}/schedule` for availability, and `PUT /appointments/{id}` to update. Layers include a `@RestController`, `@Service` for logic, and `@Repository` for JPA/MySQL. My personal project’s containerization would deploy this on Docker.
    - **Code Snippet:**
      ```java
      @RestController
      @RequestMapping("/appointments")
      public class AppointmentController {
          @Autowired
          private AppointmentService service;

          @PostMapping
          public ResponseEntity<Appointment> book(@RequestBody AppointmentRequest request) {
              return ResponseEntity.ok(service.bookAppointment(request));
          }
      }
      ```

15. **How would you integrate your CI/CD pipeline experience into a Spring Boot application’s deployment process?**
    - **Answer:** I’d use Jenkins or GitHub Actions (from NielsenIQ) to build the Spring Boot JAR with Maven, create a Docker image, and deploy to Kubernetes. My 25% deployment time reduction at NielsenIQ proves this efficiency.

16. **How would you architect a Spring Boot app to integrate with AWS services like S3, RDS, and CloudWatch?**
    - **Answer:** I’d use Spring Boot with AWS SDK for S3 file storage, Spring Data JPA for RDS, and Actuator with CloudWatch for monitoring. My Terraform and Ansible experience at NielsenIQ (20% provisioning reduction) ensures smooth AWS integration.

19. **What’s your approach to handling technical debt in a Spring Boot codebase?**
    - **Answer:** I prioritize critical debt (e.g., performance issues), refactor incrementally during sprints, and add tests. My optimization work at NielsenIQ (30% performance gain) reflects this.

20. **How do you structure a Spring Boot project for maintainability?**
    - **Answer:** I use a layered structure: `controller` for APIs, `service` for logic, `repository` for data, and `model` for entities. My Doctor-Patient project’s modularity informs this.

#### Testing
21. **How do you approach unit testing in a Spring Boot application? What tools do you use?**
    - **Answer:** I use JUnit and Mockito to test services and controllers in isolation. At NielsenIQ, I ensured automation reliability, a principle I’d apply here.
    - **Code Snippet:**
      ```java
      @ExtendWith(MockitoExtension.class)
      public class AppointmentServiceTest {
          @Mock
          private AppointmentRepository repo;
          @InjectMocks
          private AppointmentService service;

          @Test
          public void testBookAppointment() {
              Appointment app = new Appointment();
              when(repo.save(any())).thenReturn(app);
              assertEquals(app, service.bookAppointment(new AppointmentRequest()));
          }
      }
      ```

22. **Can you explain how to write a unit test for a Spring Boot REST controller?**
    - **Answer:** I’d use `@WebMvcTest` to test the controller layer, mocking the service.
    - **Code Snippet:**
      ```java
      @WebMvcTest(AppointmentController.class)
      public class AppointmentControllerTest {
          @Autowired
          private MockMvc mockMvc;
          @MockBean
          private AppointmentService service;

          @Test
          public void testBookAppointment() throws Exception {
              when(service.bookAppointment(any())).thenReturn(new Appointment());
              mockMvc.perform(post("/appointments")
                  .contentType(MediaType.APPLICATION_JSON)
                  .content("{\"patientId\":1}"))
                  .andExpect(status().isOk());
          }
      }
      ```

23. **What’s the difference between unit tests and integration tests in a Spring Boot context?**
    - **Answer:** Unit tests isolate components (e.g., service logic) with mocks, while integration tests (e.g., with `@SpringBootTest`) verify full app behavior, including DB calls. I’d use both, as I did for CI/CD validation at NielsenIQ.

24. **How do you test database interactions in a Spring Boot app using Spring Data JPA?**
    - **Answer:** I’d use `@DataJpaTest` with an in-memory DB like H2 to test repositories.
    - **Code Snippet:**
      ```java
      @DataJpaTest
      public class AppointmentRepositoryTest {
          @Autowired
          private AppointmentRepository repo;

          @Test
          public void testSaveAppointment() {
              Appointment app = new Appointment();
              repo.save(app);
              assertEquals(1, repo.count());
          }
      }
      ```

25. **Have you used tools like Testcontainers or an in-memory database for testing?**

55. **Tell us about a challenging Spring Boot-related problem you solved.**
    - **Answer:** Adapting my NielsenIQ experience, I’d debug a slow Spring Boot API by profiling with Actuator, optimizing JPA queries, and caching—similar to my 30% performance boost.

56. **How do you debug a production issue in a Spring Boot app with limited logs?**
    - **Answer:** I’d enable Actuator’s `/loggers` endpoint, add debug logs, and use CloudWatch—building on my NielsenIQ monitoring.

57. **How has your DevOps background influenced your approach to developing Spring Boot applications?**
    - **Answer:** It emphasizes automation, scalability, and monitoring—e.g., integrating CI/CD and CloudWatch into Spring Boot workflows.

58. **What’s the most complex Spring Boot application you’ve worked on?**
    - **Answer:** Hypothetically, my Doctor-Patient system refactored to Spring Boot with microservices, JPA, and Kubernetes would be complex due to distributed design.

59. **If you joined a team with a poorly performing Spring Boot app, how would you approach fixing it?**
    - **Answer:** I’d profile with Actuator, optimize queries/caching, and enhance CI/CD—drawing on my NielsenIQ optimization experience.

60. **How would you convince a team to adopt microservices for an existing Spring Boot monolith?**
    - **Answer:** I’d show scalability benefits (e.g., my Kubernetes work) and propose a phased migration with minimal disruption.

61. **Describe a time when a Spring Boot deployment failed.**
    - **Answer:** Adapting NielsenIQ, I’d say a Docker image misconfiguration failed deployment. I’d lead rollback, fix versioning, and redeploy—ensuring uptime.

62. **How do you prioritize tasks when multiple critical issues arise?**
    - **Answer:** I’d triage by impact (e.g., downtime vs. performance), delegate to the team, and resolve systematically—learned from NielsenIQ’s high-pressure environment.
