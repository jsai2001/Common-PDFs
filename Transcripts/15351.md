## DevOps Notes: Azure Boards, Repos, and Git Operations

### 1. **Azure Boards for Project Management**
   - Azure supports different project management methodologies such as Agile, Scrum, and basic models.
   - Project tracking and scheduling are integrated with Azure's project management tools.
   - Key components include:
     - **Epic**: Represents a large body of work.
     - **Feature**: A specific module or component of a project.
     - **User Story**: Represents user needs within a feature.
     - **Task**: A smaller unit within a user story.
   - Tools: Boards, backlogs, sprints, and queries for managing tasks.

### 2. **Azure Repos for Source Control**
   - Azure DevOps provides two types of repositories:
     - **Team Foundation Version Control (TFVC)**
     - **Git**
   - Options for importing code into Azure Repos:
     - Import repository using GitHub or other URLs.
     - Push existing repositories from the local system.
     - Clone repositories (empty or with existing code).

### 3. **Repository Protocols: HTTPS vs. SSH**
   - **HTTPS**:
     - Requires tokens for each operation.
   - **SSH**:
     - Only requires loading and validating the key once.
     - After generating and copying the SSH key, it allows for seamless authentication.

### 4. **Key Generation and Configuration**
   - Generate SSH keys using `ssh-keygen` (RSA default).
   - Copy the public key and load it into Azure Repos.
   - Keys need to be reloaded if switching systems, as each machine requires its own key pair.
   
### 5. **Git Operations**
   - **Cloning**:
     - Use the `git clone` command to clone a repository from Azure Repos using SSH or HTTPS.
   - **Initializing and Configuring Git**:
     - Initialize a repository: `git init`.
     - Configure user information: `git config --global user.name "Your Name"` and `git config --global user.email "Your Email"`.
   - **Adding and Committing Files**:
     - Add files to the staging area: `git add <filename>`.
     - Commit changes: `git commit -m "Commit message"`.
     - Combined add and commit: `git commit -am "Commit message"`.
   - **Pushing Code**:
     - Push code to the remote repository: `git push`.
   
### 6. **Synchronizing Repositories**
   - **Git Pull**:
     - Fetch and merge changes from the remote repository into the local repository.
     - Useful for keeping local code up-to-date with the remote repository.
   - **Git Fetch**:
     - Fetch changes from the remote repository without merging into the local repository.
     - Later, use `git merge` to manually integrate the changes.
   
### 7. **Handling Merge Conflicts**
   - Merge conflicts occur when two developers make conflicting changes to the same line of code.
   - Resolution requires manual intervention, often through discussion or using tools like Vim, Meld, or other merge conflict resolvers.
   
### 8. **Advanced Git Operations**
   - Use `git blame` to see commit history for specific lines of code.
   - Continuous integration of changes can help prevent conflicts and keep code synchronized across teams.

This structured summary of key concepts related to Azure DevOps, repositories, and Git operations will help guide your DevOps practices effectively.

# DevOps Notes: Git Commands and Operations

## 1. **Git Checkout**
   - Use `git checkout <file_name>` to discard uncommitted changes in a specific file.
   - It restores the file to the last committed state.

## 2. **Git Add and Commit**
   - You can perform both adding to the staging area and committing changes simultaneously using `git commit -a`.
   - View commit history using `git log`, and limit the number of logs by using `git log -<number>` (e.g., `git log -2` for the last two commits).

## 3. **Git Revert**
   - `git revert <commit_ID>` undoes the changes of a specific commit and creates a new commit with the reverted changes.
   - Suitable for use in public branches as it preserves the commit history, allowing collaboration with multiple developers.

## 4. **Git Reset**
   - **Purpose:** Reverts the state of the repository to a previous commit, with different options for how to handle the working directory and staging area.
   - **Types of Reset:**
     - **Mixed (default)**: Removes commits but keeps changes in the working directory, making files unstaged (`git reset <commit_ID>`).
     - **Soft**: Moves the current branch to a previous commit but keeps changes in the staging area (`git reset --soft <commit_ID>`).
     - **Hard**: Completely removes the changes, including from the working directory and staging area (`git reset --hard <commit_ID>`). This is permanent and cannot be undone.

## 5. **Difference Between Revert and Reset**
   - **Revert**: Maintains the commit history by creating a new commit with the reversed changes. Useful in public repositories where preserving the commit history is critical.
   - **Reset**: Removes the commit entirely and can undo multiple commits, potentially altering history. Not recommended for public repositories.

## 6. **Git Status and Staging Area**
   - `git status`: Shows the current state of the working directory and the staging area.
   - After resetting, if you see the message "nothing to commit", it means no changes have been staged for commit.
   - Use `git add <file_name>` to move files to the staging area before committing.

## 7. **Best Practices for Using Reset**
   - **Soft Reset**: Use when you want to undo commits but keep your changes in the staging area, ready for future commits.
   - **Mixed Reset**: Use when you want to undo commits but keep your changes in the working directory for editing.
   - **Hard Reset**: Use when you want to discard all changes, reverting to a previous state with no trace of the removed commits.

## 8. **When to Use Reset vs Revert**
   - **Reset**: Best for local or private branches when you want to completely remove commits.
   - **Revert**: Best for public branches when you need to undo changes but want to keep a record in the commit history for collaboration purposes.

## 9. **Final Thoughts**
   - Always choose the appropriate command based on whether you need to preserve the commit history and collaborate with others.
   - `git reset --hard` is the most destructive option and should be used with caution, as it permanently deletes changes.

## DevOps Git Commands Summary

### 1. **Understanding Git Reset vs. Revert**
- **Git Reset** removes changes up to the previous commit, but **does not affect the current commit**.
- **Git Revert** undoes the changes made by a specific commit by creating a new commit.
- Reset can remove up to a certain commit, but it won't remove the one provided as an argument.
- In contrast, revert directly removes the specific commit provided.

### 2. **Creating and Managing Branches**
- To **list branches**: `git branch`
- To **create a new branch**: `git branch <branch_name>`
- **Switching branches**: `git checkout <branch_name>`
- Example: `git checkout dev` switches to the `dev` branch.
- **Committing in a branch**: `git commit -m "First commit in Dev branch"`
- **Merging branches**: `git merge <branch_name>` merges changes from the specified branch into the current branch.

### 3. **Renaming and Deleting Branches**
- **Renaming a branch**: `git branch -m <new_branch_name>`
  - Example: `git branch -m dev1` renames `dev` to `dev1`.
- **Deleting a branch**: `git branch -d <branch_name>`
  - Example: `git branch -d prod` deletes the `prod` branch.

### 4. **Creating and Switching to Branch in One Command**
- **Create and switch to a branch**: `git checkout -b <branch_name>`
  - This command creates and switches to the specified branch in a single step.
  
### 5. **Merging Changes from One Branch to Another**
- **Git merge** integrates changes from one branch to another.
  - Example: Merging `dev` branch into `master`: `git merge dev`.
  
### 6. **Cherry Picking Specific Commits**
- **Cherry-picking** allows you to apply changes from specific commits from one branch to another.
  - Example: `git cherry-pick <commit_id>` moves the specific commit to the current branch.

### 7. **Git Rebase for Rewriting History**
- **Rebase** rewrites the commit history of the current branch.
  - Example: `git rebase master` brings changes from `master` branch to the current branch.
  - Itâ€™s recommended not to use **rebase** in public repositories.

### 8. **Saving Temporary Changes: Git Stash**
- **Git stash** temporarily saves changes without committing them.
  - This command stores the working directory's uncommitted changes in a stash.
  - Use `git stash` to store changes and `git stash apply` to restore them later.

### 9. **Handling Conflicts in Git**
- When merging or rebasing, conflicts may occur.
- To resolve conflicts: open the file, make necessary changes, and complete the merge or rebase.

These summarized commands are essential in managing Git repositories for collaborative development, especially in handling branches, commits, and integrating changes between branches efficiently.

Here's a summarized version of your DevOps notes with appropriate headings:

# DevOps Git Workflow Notes

## Introduction
- **Git Stash**: Useful for saving incomplete tasks or work-in-progress (WIP) files temporarily without committing them. You can clear stashed items by referencing the stash ID.

## Branching in Git
- **Viewing Repositories**: Each repository can contain multiple branches.
- **Creating a Branch**: Use the command to create a new branch locally or from remote repositories. For example:
  ```
  git branch <branch-name>
  ```
- **Pushing Branches to Remote**: After creating a branch locally, push it to remote using:
  ```
  git push origin <branch-name>
  ```
- **Deleting Branches**: To delete a branch locally and remotely, use:
  ```
  git branch -d <branch-name>   # Local deletion
  git push origin --delete <branch-name>   # Remote deletion
  ```

## Tagging in Git
- **Creating Tags**: Tags are used to mark specific points in history. Create a tag using:
  ```
  git tag <tag-name>
  ```
- **Types of Tags**: 
  - **Lightweight Tags**: Simple tags with no additional info.
  - **Annotated Tags**: Tags with additional metadata, created using:
    ```
    git tag -a <tag-name> -m "message"
    ```
- **Pushing Tags to Remote**: Use the following command to push a specific tag:
  ```
  git push origin <tag-name>
  ```
- **Deleting Tags**: Tags can also be deleted using:
  ```
  git push origin --delete <tag-name>
  ```

## Pull Requests
- **Creating a Pull Request**: Allows collaboration and code review before merging changes into the master branch. To create a pull request:
  - Specify the title and description.
  - Add reviewers to assess the changes.
  
## Advanced Security and Scanning
- **Integration with Security Tools**: Utilize scanning tools to check for vulnerabilities and compliance with security standards (e.g., CIS standards) before deploying code.

## Service Connections in Azure DevOps
- **Creating Service Connections**: Essential for integrating Azure DevOps with external services (e.g., GitHub, Docker, Azure services). Steps include:
  1. Go to project settings.
  2. Select **Service connections**.
  3. Choose the type of connection (e.g., GitHub).
  4. Authenticate using a personal access token (PAT).

- **Connecting to Azure Services**:
  - Use **Azure Resource Manager** for connections.
  - Set up service principals for authentication.

### DevOps Notes Summary

#### 1. **Service Connections in Azure DevOps**
   - **Definition**: Service connections are critical for enabling Azure DevOps to communicate and collaborate with external services like Azure or other environments.
   - **Purpose**: Service connections provide the necessary authentication and authorization to manage pipelines and integrate with external services.
   - **Creation**: 
     - A connection is established between Azure DevOps and Azure by creating an app registration in Azure Active Directory.
     - Permissions are granted for specific subscriptions, and tokens and secrets are generated from the app registration to manage these permissions.
   - **Editing and Deleting**: Service connections can be edited or deleted as needed, including updating tokens for reauthorization.
   - **Importance**: Without a service connection, pipelines cannot be built or jobs executed, as authentication with external services is required.

#### 2. **Pipeline Setup and Build Process**
   - **Job Creation**: The process starts with creating jobs, which are built using code repositories, such as HTML, Maven, or other tools, depending on the application's requirements.
   - **Azure App Services**: If deploying applications to Azure, app services are created first, and then the jobs are deployed under these app services.
   - **Artifact Management**: After the build process, artifacts are published and stored for reference, such as HTML files, which can be accessed and viewed.

#### 3. **Pipeline Triggers**
   - **Manual Trigger**: Pipelines can be triggered manually, allowing for direct control over when jobs are built and deployed.
   - **Automatic Trigger**: Automated triggers can be set based on changes in the repository (such as code commits) or on a scheduled basis, ensuring the pipeline builds and deploys without manual intervention.
   - **Continuous Deployment**: This approach automates the deployment of applications to a target environment when changes are made, ensuring rapid updates and consistent delivery.

#### 4. **Working with Yaml Scripts**
   - **Yaml for Pipelines**: Yaml scripts are used to define pipeline workflows. These scripts can be generated automatically via templates or written manually in the repository.
   - **Script Usage**: Once generated, Yaml scripts direct how the pipeline stages execute, such as building, testing, or deploying the application.

#### 5. **Test Automation and Code Quality**
   - **Test Plans**: Testing tools within Azure DevOps can be integrated into the pipeline to automate tests and ensure code quality.
   - **Automation Tools**: Azure DevOps supports various automation tools for testing, which can be integrated to streamline testing processes.
   - **Code Quality**: Tools like SonarQube can be integrated into the pipeline to ensure code quality, helping to detect and fix issues early in the development cycle.

#### 6. **Advanced Integrations**
   - **Docker and ACR Integration**: DevOps pipelines can integrate with Docker and Azure Container Registry (ACR) for containerized application deployment.
   - **Kubernetes Integration**: Applications can also be deployed to Kubernetes clusters, allowing for scalable and efficient management of containerized applications.
   - **Azure App Services**: Code can be deployed directly to Azure App Services as part of the pipeline, facilitating seamless integration with cloud infrastructure.

#### 7. **Future Discussions**
   - The next sessions will focus on:
     - Detailed pipeline creation.
     - Release pipeline creation.
     - Integration with Docker, ACR, and Kubernetes.
     - Code quality checks using SonarQube.
     - Continuous deployment workflows for production-ready code.

#### 8. **Common Pipeline Operations**
   - **Viewing Logs**: Logs of pipeline executions, including commit IDs and build details, can be viewed to track the status and troubleshoot any issues.
   - **Pipeline Stages**: Multiple stages of pipelines can be created to manage different phases like build, test, and deploy, all integrated within Azure DevOps.

2. **Git**

### Importing Code to Azure Repos
You can import code using:
- **Import Repository**: Provide a URL (e.g., GitHub).
- **Push from Command Line**: Push existing local Git repositories.
- **Clone Repository**: Either an empty repo or one with existing code.

### Authentication Methods
Two primary methods for pushing code:
1. **HTTPS**: Requires token for each operation.
2. **SSH**: Only needs key verification once after initial setup.

---

## Working with Git

### SSH Key Generation
To use SSH for Git operations, you need to generate SSH keys:

```bash
ssh-keygen -t rsa -b 4096 -C "your_email@example.com"
```

### Adding SSH Key to Azure Repos
1. Copy the public key:
   ```bash
   cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub
   ```
2. Add the key to Azure Repos under SSH keys.

```bash
git commit -am "First commit"
```

### Pushing Code to Remote
Push your changes to the remote repository:
```bash
git push origin main
```

---

## Syncing with Remote Repository

### Pulling Changes
To bring remote changes into your local repository:
```bash
git pull
```
This command downloads and merges changes into your local repository.

### Fetching Changes
If you want to only download changes without merging:
```bash
git fetch
```
To integrate fetched changes:
```bash
git merge
```

### Handling Merge Conflicts

# DevOps Notes: Git Commands for Managing Commits

## Overview
This document summarizes key Git commands related to managing commits, including how to revert changes, reset commits, and maintain a clean commit history. 

## Removing Uncommitted Changes
To discard uncommitted changes in a specific file, you can use:

```bash
git checkout -- <file_name>
```
This command will revert the file to its last committed state.

## Committing Changes
To add changes to the staging area and commit them in one command, you can use:

```bash
git commit -am "Your commit message"
```

To view the commit history, you can use:

```bash
git log
```
You can limit the number of logs displayed with:

```bash
git log -n <number>
```
For example, to see the last two commits:

```bash
git log -2
```

## Reverting Changes
If you need to revert committed changes, the command is:

```bash
git revert <commit_id>
```
This will create a new commit that undoes the changes made by the specified commit.

### Viewing Logs after Reverting
You can check the commit history after a revert to ensure the log maintains a record of all operations:

```bash
git log
```

## Resetting Commits
There are three modes for `git reset`: `soft`, `mixed`, and `hard`.

### 1. Mixed Reset
To undo the last commit but keep the changes in the staging area, use:

```bash
git reset --mixed <commit_id>
```

### 2. Soft Reset
To move the changes back to the staging area without losing any modifications, use:

```bash
git reset --soft <commit_id>
```
This keeps all changes intact and ready for re-commit.

### 3. Hard Reset
To completely remove all changes and commit history up to a certain point, use:

```bash
git reset --hard <commit_id>
```
**Warning**: This will permanently delete the specified commits and their changes.

### Example of Resetting
To perform a mixed reset to a previous commit:

```bash
git reset --mixed <commit_id>
```

### Checking Status After Reset
To check the status of your repository after a reset, use:

```bash
git status
```
This command will show you the current state of the working directory and staging area.

## Summary of Differences Between Reset Types
- **Mixed Reset**: Changes are unstaged but kept in the working directory.
- **Soft Reset**: Changes are kept in the staging area.
- **Hard Reset**: Changes are completely discarded.

## Using `git restore`
To discard changes in the working directory for a specific file, you can use:

```bash
git restore <file_name>
```
This is useful for quickly removing unwanted changes.

## Best Practices
- Use **`git revert`** for public branches to maintain a clear commit history.
- **`git reset`** is more suited for local or feature branches where you can safely manipulate commit history without affecting others.

## Conclusion
Understanding how to manage commits using Git is crucial for maintaining a clean and organized project history. Using the appropriate commands for reverting and resetting changes will help streamline your development process.

# Azure DevOps Notes

## Overview
Azure DevOps provides tools for managing the entire development lifecycle, including planning, development, testing, and deployment. A crucial component of Azure DevOps is the service connection, which allows integration with Azure resources.

## Service Connections
### Importance of Service Connections
- Service connections enable Azure DevOps to communicate with other services and environments.
- They are essential for building pipelines that can deploy code to various services.

### Creating a Service Connection
1. **App Registration**: Create an app registration in Azure Active Directory.
2. **Subscription Information**: Provide details about the Azure subscription.
3. **Permissions**: Assign necessary permissions under the specific subscription.
4. **Generate Tokens**: Create tokens and secrets from the app registration.

### Managing Service Connections
- Service connections can be deleted or edited as needed.
- Tokens can be updated to ensure ongoing integration.

## Creating and Managing Jobs
### Setting Up Jobs
- Jobs can be created to automate builds and deployments.
- To set up a job:
  - Navigate to the setup section in Azure DevOps.
  - Choose the build technology (e.g., HTML, Maven).
  - Configure the job to deploy to Azure App Services.

### Building the Job
```yaml
# Sample YAML for a simple build pipeline
trigger:
- main

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'

steps:
- task: NodeTool@0
  inputs:
    versionSpec: '14.x'
  
- script: npm install
  displayName: 'Install npm packages'

- script: npm run build
  displayName: 'Build the application'

- task: AzureWebApp@1
  inputs:
    azureSubscription: 'MyAzureSubscription'
    appType: 'webApp'
    appName: 'MyWebApp'
    package: '$(System.DefaultWorkingDirectory)/**/*.zip'
```

### Viewing Job Artifacts
- After a job runs, artifacts can be viewed in the Azure DevOps portal.
- Artifacts are generated outputs from the build process.

## Triggering Pipelines
### Manual vs Automatic Triggers
- **Manual Trigger**: Initiates the pipeline manually.
- **Automatic Trigger**: Triggers based on:
  - Code commits to repositories.
  - Scheduled times.

### Scheduling Jobs
- Jobs can be configured to run on specific schedules for automation.

## YAML Pipeline Configuration
### Creating YAML Pipelines
- YAML pipelines can be generated using templates or directly written in the repository.
- A typical pipeline configuration might look like this:

```yaml
# Example YAML pipeline configuration
jobs:
- job: Build
  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
  steps:
  - script: echo Building...
  
- job: Deploy
  dependsOn: Build
  pool:
    vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
  steps:
  - script: echo Deploying...
```

## Integration with Testing Tools
- Azure DevOps supports integration with various testing automation tools, enhancing the CI/CD workflow.
- Code quality checks can be integrated using tools like SonarQube.

## Future Discussions
In upcoming sessions, the focus will be on:
- Detailed creation of pipelines.
- Release pipelines and continuous deployment strategies.
- Integration with Docker and Azure Container Registry.
- Deployment to Kubernetes clusters and Azure App Services.

## Conclusion
- Understanding service connections, jobs, triggers, and YAML configuration is crucial for effective Azure DevOps usage.
- Continued exploration of testing integration and deployment strategies will enhance the CI/CD process.
