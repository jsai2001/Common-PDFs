```yaml
- task: SonarQubePrepare@4
  inputs:
    SonarQube: 'SonarQubeConnection'
    scannerMode: 'CLI'
    configInFile: 'sonar-project.properties'
```

### Example `sonar-project.properties`
```properties
# sonar-project.properties
sonar.projectKey=my_project
sonar.projectName=My Project
sonar.sources=src
sonar.language=java
```

### Running the Pipeline
1. Save and run the pipeline to start the CI/CD process.
2. Ensure continuous integration by enabling triggers in the pipeline settings.

```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - main  # Adjust to your main branch name
```

### Automatic Trigger on Code Change
Whenever changes are pushed to the specified branch, the pipeline will trigger automatically, checking for code quality with SonarQube before proceeding to the build steps.

# DevOps Pipeline Management

## 1. Pipeline Triggers

Triggers are essential for automating the execution of pipelines. There are two primary methods for triggering pipelines:

### 1.1. Manual Triggers
- **Purpose**: Manually initiate the pipeline whenever necessary.

### 1.2. Scheduled Triggers
- **Description**: Schedule jobs to run at specific intervals or on specific days.
- **Example**: Running a pipeline every Monday, except for Wednesday.

### 1.3. Continuous Integration (CI)
- **Description**: Automatically trigger the pipeline whenever code changes are pushed by developers.
- **Advantages**: No manual intervention required; ensures that builds are up-to-date.

## 2. Enabling Continuous Integration

To enable CI in Azure Pipelines:
1. **Configuration**: Set the options to trigger automatically when changes are made to the master branch.
2. **Agent Selection**: Choose the appropriate agent for the pipeline, e.g., Ubuntu latest.

### Sample YAML Configuration
```yaml
trigger:
  branches:
    include:
      - master

pool:
  vmImage: 'ubuntu-latest'
```

## 3. Pipeline Stages

Pipelines can consist of multiple stages:
- **Code Checkout**: Retrieve the latest code from the repository.
- **Build**: Use build tools (e.g., Maven) to compile the code.
- **Quality Checks**: Integrate tools like SonarQube to analyze code quality.

### 3.1. Build Process Example
```yaml
steps:
- script: mvn clean install
  displayName: 'Build with Maven'
```

## 4. Artifacts Management

Artifacts are the files produced by the build process:
- **Types of Artifacts**: Common formats include `.war` (Web Archive) or `.jar` (Java Archive).
- **Publishing Artifacts**: Once built, artifacts are published for deployment.

### Example of Artifact Publishing
```yaml
- publish: $(Build.ArtifactStagingDirectory)
  artifact: drop
```

## 5. Quality Assurance with SonarQube

Integrate SonarQube for static code analysis:
- **Configuration**: Ensure the SonarQube plugin is installed and configured in Azure DevOps.
- **Quality Metrics**: Monitor vulnerabilities, code smells, and duplication percentage.

## 6. Release Pipelines

Release pipelines are used for deploying the built artifacts to production environments:
- **Approval Process**: Deployment only occurs after necessary approvals.
- **Deployment Targets**: Common targets include web servers like Apache Tomcat.

### 6.1. Tomcat Setup
1. **Install Java**: Java must be installed before setting up Tomcat.
2. **Deploy Artifacts**: Deploy the `.war` file to the Tomcat server.

### Tomcat Installation Example
```bash
# Install Java
sudo apt update
sudo apt install openjdk-11-jdk

# Install Tomcat
sudo apt install tomcat9
```

## 7. Conclusion

Automation of DevOps processes through pipeline management improves efficiency and ensures high-quality deployments. By setting up CI/CD pipelines, scheduling jobs, and utilizing tools for quality assurance, teams can streamline their development workflow.

# Azure DevOps and Jenkins Integration

## Overview
The goal is to trigger Jenkins builds automatically from Azure DevOps events, specifically upon code pushes or build completions. This integration can be facilitated using **Service Hooks** in Azure DevOps.

## Setting Up Service Hooks

### Step 1: Access Project Settings
1. Navigate to your Azure DevOps project.
2. Go to **Project Settings**.
3. Find and select **Service Hooks**.

### Step 2: Create a Service Hook Subscription
- Choose the desired service to integrate, such as **Jenkins** or **Microsoft Teams**.
- Configure the environment and decide which event triggers the action (e.g., code push).

### Example Service Hook Setup
```plaintext
- Service: Jenkins
- Trigger: Code Push
- Repository: Your Repository Name
- Job: Specify the Jenkins job to trigger
```

## Configuring Jenkins for Azure DevOps

### Step 1: Importing Repositories
- In Jenkins, import the repositories you want to work with.
  
### Step 2: Generate API Token in Jenkins
To enable Azure DevOps to communicate with Jenkins, generate an API token:
1. Go to your Jenkins dashboard.
2. Navigate to **User Configuration**.
3. Find the **API Token** section and click on **Add New Token**.
4. Name the token (e.g., `AzureDevOpsIntegration`) and generate it.

### Code to Test Connection
In Azure DevOps, test the connection to Jenkins:
```plaintext
- URL: http://<your-jenkins-url>
- Username: admin (or your Jenkins username)
- API Token: <generated-token>
```
Verify the connection succeeds.

## Triggering Jenkins Jobs
When configuring your service hook, specify what event triggers the Jenkins job:
- **Code Push**: Trigger a job whenever code is pushed to the repository.
- **Build Completion**: Trigger a job once a build is completed in Azure DevOps.

### Example Trigger Configuration
```plaintext
- Trigger Type: Generic Build
- Event: Code Push or Build Completion
- Jenkins Job: <Your Jenkins Job Name>
```

## Additional Integrations
Azure DevOps service hooks can also integrate with other tools:
- **Monitoring Tools**: DataDog, Grafana.
- **Communication Tools**: Microsoft Teams, Slack, Trello.
- **Azure Services**: Azure App Services, Azure Service Bus.

### Setting Up Integration with DataDog
To send logs to DataDog:
1. Configure DataDog API keys in Azure DevOps.
2. Set up a service hook to send logs automatically upon events.

## Important Concepts

### Service Hooks vs. Service Connections
- **Service Hooks**: Used to send notifications or trigger actions in external services when events happen in Azure DevOps.
- **Service Connections**: Necessary for establishing connections to external services (e.g., GitHub, Docker). Required plugins must be installed first from the Azure DevOps Marketplace.

### Installation of Plugins
1. Visit the Azure DevOps Marketplace.
2. Install the necessary plugins to establish service connections.

### Example Service Connection Setup
```plaintext
- Service: GitHub
- Connection Type: GitHub or GitHub Enterprise
- Required Plugins: GitHub Connector
```

## Conclusion
The integration of Azure DevOps with Jenkins and other services through service hooks allows for automated workflows and improved CI/CD processes. Proper configuration of service hooks and service connections is essential for seamless operation.
