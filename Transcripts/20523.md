- You can filter these items based on conditions such as:
  - Start date
  - Work item type
  - Accepted by
  - State (e.g., Done, In Progress)

### Example Query
```sql
SELECT * FROM WorkItems
WHERE State = 'Done'
  AND AcceptedBy = 'John Doe'
ORDER BY StartDate ASC;
```

## 3. Azure Boards Overview
- Azure Boards is a component of Azure DevOps used for project management.
- Methodologies available include Scrum, Kanban, and more.

### Example Work Item Creation
```markdown

# DevOps Git Commands and Workflow

## 1. Initializing a Git Repository

To start a new Git repository in a directory, use the following command:

```bash
git init
```

This creates a hidden `.git` directory in your current folder, which contains all the necessary metadata for the repository.

## 2. Creating Files

To create a new file, you can use the `touch` command:

```bash
touch index.html
```

You can then add content to `index.html` using any text editor.

## 3. Staging Changes

To move files to the staging area, use the `git add` command. If you want to stage a specific file, use:

```bash
git add index.html
```

To stage all changes in the current directory:

```bash
git add .
```

### 3.1 Checking Status

To check the status of your files, use:

```bash
git status
```

This command shows which files are staged, untracked, or modified.

## 4. Committing Changes

After staging the changes, you need to commit them to your local repository:

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit"
```

This records the changes in the repository with a message.

## 5. Pushing Changes to Remote Repository

To push your commits from the local repository to a remote repository, first, you need to add the remote URL:

```bash
git remote add origin <remote-repository-URL>
```

Then push your changes:

```bash
git push -u origin master
```

## 6. Renaming Remote Repository

If you need to rename the remote repository, you can use the following command:

```bash
git remote rename origin new-name
```

To remove a remote:

```bash
git remote remove <remote-name>
```

## 7. Viewing Commit History

To view the commit history, use:

```bash
git log
```

For a summarized view, use:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

## 8. Undoing Changes

### 8.1 Discarding Uncommitted Changes

If you want to discard changes in your working directory, use:

```bash
git checkout -- index.html
```

### 8.2 Reverting a Commit

To revert a committed change, you can use:

```bash
git revert <commit-id>
```

This command will create a new commit that undoes the changes made in the specified commit.

## 9. Stashing Changes

If you want to temporarily save changes without committing them, you can stash them:

```bash
git stash
```

To apply the stashed changes later, use:

```bash
git stash apply
```

## 10. Creating Branches

To create a new branch, use:

```bash
git branch <branch-name>
```

To switch to that branch:

```bash
git checkout <branch-name>
```

## 11. Merging Changes

When you are ready to merge your changes from one branch to another, you can use:

```bash
git merge <branch-name>
```
