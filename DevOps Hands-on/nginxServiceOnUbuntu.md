Given your requirement to set up an Ubuntu instance on AWS with the nginx service configured and to use http://public-ip instead of https://public-ip, here are structured notes and a script for the user-data section:

Structured Notes for Ubuntu Instance Setup on AWS
Instance Specifications:
Instance Type: t2.micro
VPC: Default VPC
Subnet: Default Subnet
AMI: Canonical, Ubuntu, 20.04 LTS (or latest LTS version available in AWS)
Storage: 8GB Default Volume Storage

Security Group Configuration:
Inbound Rules:
Port 80 (HTTP) - TCP - 0.0.0.0/0
Port 443 (HTTPS) - TCP - 0.0.0.0/0
Port 22 (SSH) - TCP - 0.0.0.0/0
Outbound Rules: All traffic - All protocols - 0.0.0.0/0

Steps to Configure the Instance:

Launch Instance: Use the AWS Management Console or CLI to launch a new EC2 instance with the specified settings.
User Data Script: Use the following script in the user-data field during instance launch to automate the setup:

bash
#!/bin/bash

# Update package list
apt update -y

# Install nginx
apt install -y nginx

# Start nginx service
systemctl start nginx

# Enable nginx to start on boot
systemctl enable nginx

# Create a simple index.html for testing
echo "<html><body><h1>Welcome to My Ubuntu Server on AWS!</h1></body></html>" > /var/www/html/index.html

# Ensure correct permissions for the web content
chown -R www-data:www-data /var/www/html
chmod -R 755 /var/www/html

# Firewall configuration (using ufw on Ubuntu)
ufw allow 'Nginx HTTP'
ufw enable

# Note: Use http://public-ip instead of https://public-ip
# Using https://public-ip results in a page load error due to SSL/TLS certificate issues.
# You can access the server using http://<public-ip> or the public DNS name provided by AWS.

# Optionally, you can add logging or additional configurations here

Additional Notes:
User Data: This script runs with root privileges when the instance boots for the first time. It updates the package list, installs Nginx, starts the service, enables it to start on boot, creates a simple index.html for verification, sets correct permissions, and configures the firewall (ufw) to allow HTTP traffic.
Security Group: Ensure that the security group associated with this instance has the inbound rules allowing HTTP (80), HTTPS (443), and SSH (22) from any IP address (0.0.0.0/0). The outbound rules are set to allow all traffic.
AMI Selection: Use the latest LTS version of Ubuntu available in AWS, typically found under "Canonical, Ubuntu, 20.04 LTS" or similar, depending on the latest release.
Accessing the Server: After the instance is launched and the script runs, you should access your webpage by visiting http://<public-ip> or the public DNS name of your instance in a web browser. Do not use https as it results in a page load error due to SSL/TLS certificate issues.
Troubleshooting: If you encounter issues, check the instance's system log in the EC2 console for any errors during the user-data script execution or check the Nginx logs on the instance (/var/log/nginx/) for service-related issues.

This script and configuration should get your Ubuntu instance with Nginx up and running, accessible via HTTP. Remember, this setup does not include SSL/TLS configuration, which is why you're directed to use HTTP instead of HTTPS.
