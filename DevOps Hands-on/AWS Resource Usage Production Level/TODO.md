    * Demonstrates container orchestration.
    * Example: Deploying containerized applications.
    
## Advanced Concept to learn

* Amazon CloudFront
    * Demonstrates content delivery network (CDN) usage.
    * Example: Distributing static and dynamic web content globally.

* Amazon SQS (Simple Queue Service)
    * Demonstrates decoupling of microservices.
    * Example: Queueing tasks for asynchronous processing.

* AWS CloudFormation
    * Demonstrates infrastructure as code.
    * Example: Automating the deployment of your entire infrastructure.

* AWS Elastic Beanstalk
    * Demonstrates platform as a service (PaaS).
    * Example: Deploying and managing applications without worrying about the underlying infrastructure.


* AWS Lambda
    * Demonstrates serverless computing.
    * Example: Running background tasks or processing data.
