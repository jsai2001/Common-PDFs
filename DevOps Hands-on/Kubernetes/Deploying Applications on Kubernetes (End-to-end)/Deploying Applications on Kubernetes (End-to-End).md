The syntax you've provided is from Terraform, a popular Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tool used for provisioning and managing cloud infrastructure. Here's a breakdown of what each part means:

### Syntax Explanation:
- **cidr_block**: This is a variable or attribute in Terraform where you're setting or defining the value.
- **=**: Assignment operator, setting the value of `cidr_block`.
- **cidrsubnet(aws_vpc.eks_vpc.cidr_block, 8, count.index + 3)**: This is a call to the `cidrsubnet` function in Terraform. Let's break down this function call:

#### Function `cidrsubnet`:
- **First Argument (`aws_vpc.eks_vpc.cidr_block`)**: This is the base CIDR block from which you're creating a subnet. Here, it's fetching the CIDR block of a VPC named `eks_vpc`.
- **Second Argument (`8`)**: This is the number of new bits you're adding to the network portion of the base CIDR block to create a new subnet. If the base CIDR is something like `10.0.0.0/16`, adding 8 bits would give you `10.0.0.0/24` (but with some offset due to the third argument).
- **Third Argument (`count.index + 3`)**: 
    - `count.index` refers to the current index in a count loop in Terraform, which is used to create multiple instances of a resource. 
    - Adding 3 to it means you're creating subnets with an offset. If `count.index` starts at 0, the first subnet would have an offset of 3, the second an offset of 4, and so on.

### What This Does:
This expression dynamically generates CIDR blocks for subnets based on the VPC's CIDR block. Here's how:

- If `aws_vpc.eks_vpc.cidr_block` is `10.0.0.0/16`, adding 8 new bits means you're dividing the VPC into 256 possible `/24` subnets (since 2^8 = 256).
- With `count.index + 3`, you're selecting from these subnets, but you're starting from the 4th possible `/24` subnet (since the first three are skipped).

For example:
- If `count.index` is 0, `cidrsubnet(10.0.0.0/16, 8, 3)` would result in `10.0.3.0/24`.
- If `count.index` is 1, it would be `10.0.4.0/24`, and so on.

This approach is useful for creating a series of subnets systematically within a VPC, ensuring each subnet has a unique CIDR block based on a predefined pattern.

### Steps to Deploy Your Application on Kubernetes

Based on the files you've shown in the image, here's the order in which you should execute Terraform and Kubernetes commands to deploy your application on Kubernetes. This assumes you're familiar with basic Terraform and Kubernetes command-line operations:

#### Step 1: Initialize Terraform
First, you need to initialize Terraform to set up the working directory and download the necessary providers.

```bash
terraform init
```

#### Step 2: Plan Terraform Execution
Before applying changes, it's good practice to see what Terraform will do.

```bash
terraform plan
```

#### Step 3: Apply Terraform Configuration
This command will create or update infrastructure according to your main.tf file, which likely includes setting up the EKS cluster, node groups, etc.

```bash
terraform apply
```

After Terraform has applied the configuration, your EKS cluster should be up and running. Now, you'll move to deploying your application with Kubernetes.

#### Step 4: Deploy Static Website Deployment
This step deploys the base deployment for your static website.

```bash
kubectl apply -f static-website-deployment.yaml
```

#### Step 5: Deploy Static Website Service
This exposes your deployment as a service, allowing it to be accessible within the cluster or externally if configured.

```bash
kubectl apply -f static-website-service.yaml
```

#### Step 6: Apply ConfigMap for Website Content
Assuming `website-content-configmap.yaml` contains configuration for your static website content, this step applies it to your Kubernetes cluster.

```bash
kubectl apply -f website-content-configmap.yaml
```

### Summary of Commands in Order:
```bash
terraform init
terraform plan
terraform apply
kubectl apply -f static-website-deployment.yaml
kubectl apply -f static-website-service.yaml
kubectl apply -f website-content-configmap.yaml
```

### Notes:
- Ensure you are in the correct directory where these files are located when running these commands.
- `terraform.lock.hcl` and the `.tfstate` files are automatically managed by Terraform, so you don't need to interact with them directly.
- The `Deploying_Applications_on_Kubernetes_(End-to-End).md` file seems to be documentation or a guide, not something you execute.
- Make sure you've configured your AWS credentials and have the necessary permissions for Terraform to interact with AWS, and that `kubectl` is configured to interact with your EKS cluster (via `aws eks update-kubeconfig --name your-cluster-name` or similar).
- After applying Kubernetes resources, you might want to check their status with commands like `kubectl get deployments`, `kubectl get services`, or `kubectl get configmaps` to ensure everything is running as expected.

This sequence ensures that your infrastructure is set up before you deploy your application components, following best practices for infrastructure as code and container orchestration.

### Troubleshooting DNS Resolution Issues with EKS

The error you're encountering suggests that `kubectl` is unable to resolve the DNS name for your EKS cluster's API server, which is necessary for downloading the OpenAPI schema used for validation. Here are steps to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

#### 1. Verify DNS Resolution
First, ensure that your DNS settings are correct and your system can resolve the EKS cluster endpoint:

```bash
dig +short E10CACC03D6DACAF3EFA119DEEC40844.yl4.ap-south-1.eks.amazonaws.com
```

If this command doesn't return an IP address, there's a DNS resolution problem. You might need to check your network settings or DNS server configuration.

#### 2. Check Kubeconfig
Ensure your `kubectl` is configured correctly to communicate with your EKS cluster:

```bash
kubectl config view
```

Look for the `server` field in the context or cluster section related to your EKS cluster. It should match the address in the error (`https://E10CACC03D6DACAF3EFA119DEEC40844.yl4.ap-south-1.eks.amazonaws.com`). If it's incorrect, update it:

```bash
aws eks update-kubeconfig --name your-cluster-name --region ap-south-1
```

Replace `your-cluster-name` with the actual name of your EKS cluster.

#### 3. Network Issues
- **VPN or Proxy**: If you're behind a VPN or proxy, ensure it's configured correctly to allow access to AWS services.
- **Firewall**: Check if there are any firewall rules blocking the connection to AWS EKS endpoints.

#### 4. EKS Cluster Health
Verify that your EKS cluster is healthy and running:

```bash
aws eks describe-cluster --name your-cluster-name --region ap-south-1 --query "cluster.status"
```

If the status is not `ACTIVE`, there might be an issue with the cluster itself.

#### 5. Temporary Workaround - Disable Validation
If you need to proceed immediately and can't resolve the DNS issue right away, you can apply the YAML file with validation turned off:

```bash
kubectl apply -f static-website-deployment.yaml --validate=false
```

Note: This is not recommended as a long-term solution since validation helps catch configuration errors before they're applied.

#### 6. Check AWS CLI Configuration
Ensure your AWS CLI is configured correctly with the right credentials and region:

```bash
aws configure list
```

Make sure the region matches `ap-south-1` and that your credentials are valid.

#### 7. Internet Connectivity
Ensure you have a stable internet connection, as DNS resolution and API server communication require internet access.

#### 8. Cluster Endpoint Access
If your cluster has private endpoint access enabled, make sure you're connecting from within the VPC or have the necessary VPN setup to access the private endpoint.

### Conclusion
If after these steps the issue persists, consider:
- Rechecking your AWS account for any service limits or restrictions.
- Contacting AWS Support for further assistance, especially if the DNS resolution continues to fail despite correct configurations.

Remember, solving DNS issues might require coordination with your network administrator or AWS support, especially if it's related to your organization's network policies or AWS's DNS service.
