# Step-by-Step Process for Kubernetes Hands-On Exercises

## Introduction to Kubernetes

- Understand the basics of Kubernetes, its architecture, and key components (Pods, Nodes, Services, Deployments, etc.).
- Set up a local Kubernetes cluster using Minikube or Kind (Kubernetes in Docker).

## Setting Up a Kubernetes Cluster on AWS

- Use Amazon EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service) to set up a managed Kubernetes cluster.
- Install and configure kubectl to interact with your EKS cluster.
- Create an EKS cluster using the AWS Management Console, AWS CLI, or Infrastructure as Code (IaC) tools like Terraform.

## Deploying Applications on Kubernetes

- Create and deploy a simple application (e.g., a static website or a web server) using Kubernetes manifests (YAML files).
- Understand and use key Kubernetes objects: Pods, ReplicaSets, Deployments, and Services.
- Deploy your current project (e.g., the static website hosted on EC2) to the Kubernetes cluster.

## Configuring Networking in Kubernetes

- Set up Services to expose your application (ClusterIP, NodePort, LoadBalancer).
- Use Ingress controllers to manage external access to your services.
- Configure DNS within the cluster using CoreDNS.

## Managing Storage in Kubernetes

- Understand Persistent Volumes (PVs) and Persistent Volume Claims (PVCs).
- Use AWS EBS (Elastic Block Store) for persistent storage in your EKS cluster.
- Deploy a stateful application (e.g., a database) that requires persistent storage.

## Scaling Applications in Kubernetes

- Use Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) to scale your application based on CPU/memory usage.
- Configure Cluster Autoscaler to automatically adjust the number of nodes in your cluster.

## Monitoring and Logging in Kubernetes

- Set up monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana.
- Configure logging using Fluentd, Elasticsearch, and Kibana (EFK stack).
- Use CloudWatch for monitoring and logging in AWS.

## Securing Kubernetes

- Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) to manage permissions.
- Use Network Policies to control traffic between Pods.
- Secure your cluster with best practices (e.g., using Secrets, configuring Pod Security Policies).

## CI/CD with Kubernetes

- Integrate your Kubernetes deployments with a CI/CD pipeline using tools like Jenkins, GitLab CI, or GitHub Actions.
- Automate the deployment of your application to the Kubernetes cluster.

## Advanced Topics

- Understand and use Helm for package management in Kubernetes.
- Explore Kubernetes Operators for managing complex applications.
- Learn about Service Mesh (e.g., Istio) for advanced networking and observability.

# Hands-On Exercises

## Set Up a Local Kubernetes Cluster

- Install Minikube or Kind.
- Deploy a sample application.

## Create an EKS Cluster

- Use the AWS Management Console or AWS CLI to create an EKS cluster.
- Configure kubectl to connect to your EKS cluster.

## Deploy Your Application

- Create Kubernetes manifests for your application (e.g., static website).
- Deploy the application to your EKS cluster.

## Expose Your Application

- Create a Service to expose your application.
- Set up an Ingress controller and create an Ingress resource.

## Set Up Persistent Storage

- Create a Persistent Volume and Persistent Volume Claim.
- Deploy a stateful application that uses the persistent storage.

## Implement Autoscaling

- Configure Horizontal Pod Autoscaler (HPA) for your application.
- Set up Cluster Autoscaler for your EKS cluster.

## Set Up Monitoring and Logging

- Deploy Prometheus and Grafana for monitoring.
- Set up the EFK stack for logging.

## Secure Your Cluster

- Implement RBAC and Network Policies.
- Use Secrets to manage sensitive information.

## Integrate CI/CD

- Set up a CI/CD pipeline to automate the deployment of your application to the Kubernetes cluster.

## Explore Advanced Topics

- Use Helm to manage your application deployments.
- Learn about Kubernetes Operators and Service Mesh.

By following this structured approach and completing the hands-on exercises, you'll gain a solid understanding of Kubernetes and be well-prepared for interviews. Integrating Kubernetes with your current project will also demonstrate your ability to manage and deploy applications in a modern, containerized environment.
