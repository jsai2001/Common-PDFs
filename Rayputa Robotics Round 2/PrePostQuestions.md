### Questions to Ask at the Start of the Interview

These questions help you gain insights into the role, demonstrate preparation, and establish rapport with the interviewer.

- **"Can you tell me more about the autonomous mobile robot projects I’d be working on? What types of robots or applications is the team currently focused on?"**  
    (Shows interest in the core responsibility of QA/software development/integration for robots and sets the stage for technical discussion.)

- **"How does the team currently approach collaboration between robotics engineers and DevOps professionals like myself to build a scalable stack?"**  
    (Highlights your DevOps background and aligns with the responsibility of collaborating with robotics engineers.)

- **"What does the development workflow look like today, and what specific areas are you hoping to improve through this role?"**  
    (Signals your intent to contribute meaningfully by improving the development workflow.)

- **"Are there any cutting-edge technologies the team is particularly excited about evaluating right now?"**  
    (Demonstrates enthusiasm for innovation and aligns with the responsibility of evaluating new technologies.)

- **"What’s the scale of the production environment I’d be deploying to? For example, how many robots or applications are typically in play?"**  
    (Provides context about deployment scope and connects to your experience with production-level systems like AWS and Docker.)

### Questions to Ask at the End of the Interview

These questions help clarify expectations, wrap up the conversation, and leave a strong impression of your strategic thinking.

- **"How does the team measure success for a DevOps engineer working on autonomous mobile robots, especially in terms of reliability and scalability?"**  
    (Links to your skills in CI/CD, Terraform, and Docker for building reliable systems.)

- **"What are some of the biggest challenges the team faces in integrating software across different robot types, and how could my experience with tools like Ansible or GitHub Actions help address them?"**  
    (Shows you’re thinking about applying your specific skills to their challenges.)

- **"How often does the team evaluate and deploy new technologies to production, and what’s the process for that?"**  
    (Connects to your experience with cloud tools like AWS/Azure and the responsibility of deploying cutting-edge tech.)

- **"Can you share what the onboarding process looks like for someone joining the team? For example, would I start by shadowing robotics engineers or diving into the CI/CD pipeline?"**  
    (Helps you understand the transition into the role and ties into your Linux, Python, and CI/CD expertise.)

- **"What’s the next step in the hiring process, and is there anything specific you’d like me to prepare or elaborate on based on our discussion today?"**  
    (A practical closer that shows initiative and keeps the conversation open-ended while reinforcing your fit.)

### Tips for Asking These Questions

- **At the Start:** Ask 1-2 questions to avoid delaying the interviewer’s agenda. Choose ones that flow naturally from their opening remarks or job overview. For example, if they mention the team, start with the question about collaboration.  
- **At the End:** Select 2-3 questions based on the interview’s direction. If challenges were discussed, ask about integration challenges. If the focus was on technology, lean toward questions about cutting-edge tools. Always end with the question about next steps to close professionally.  
- **Tone:** Frame your questions positively (e.g., “I’m excited to hear about…” or “I’d love to understand how…”), showing enthusiasm and curiosity.  
- **Customization:** Relate your skills (e.g., “With my experience in Python and Docker…” or “Given my work with Terraform…”) where relevant to subtly reinforce your fit.
