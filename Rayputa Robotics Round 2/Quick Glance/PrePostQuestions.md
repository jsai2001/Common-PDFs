#### Tips for Asking
- **Start:** Pick 1-2 questions that fit their intro. E.g., ask about collaboration if they mention the team.  
- **End:** Choose 2-3 based on discussion flow—focus on challenges or tech as needed. Always close with next steps.  
- **Tone:** Stay positive (“I’m excited to learn…”), show curiosity.  
- **Customize:** Mention skills (e.g., Python, Docker) briefly to highlight fit.
