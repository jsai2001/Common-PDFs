## Resume-Based Questions

### 1. General DevOps and SRE Concepts

- **What is the difference between DevOps and SRE? How do you see your role aligning with SRE principles?**  
  DevOps is a cultural and operational philosophy focused on collaboration between development and operations to accelerate delivery through automation and shared responsibility. SRE, or Site Reliability Engineering, is a specific implementation of DevOps that applies software engineering principles to operations, emphasizing reliability, scalability, and automation. SRE uses metrics like SLIs/SLOs to ensure system health. My role aligns with SRE by prioritizing reliability through automation, incident response, and reducing toil, while still supporting rapid development cycles.

- **How do you define "reliability" in the context of a system? What metrics do you use to measure it?**  
  Reliability is the ability of a system to perform its intended function consistently under expected conditions. I measure it using Service Level Indicators (SLIs) like availability (uptime percentage), latency (response time), and error rate (failed requests). For example, an SLO might target 99.9% availability and <200ms latency, tracked via tools like CloudWatch or Prometheus.

- **Can you explain the concept of toil and how you’ve worked to reduce it in your current role?**  
  Toil is repetitive, manual, automatable work that doesn’t add long-term value, like manually restarting servers. I’ve reduced toil by automating CI/CD pipelines with Jenkins, scripting container management with Shell, and using Terraform for infrastructure provisioning, cutting manual intervention by hours weekly.

- **What’s your approach to balancing feature development velocity with system reliability?**  
  I use an error budget approach—allowing a small, defined failure rate (e.g., 0.1% downtime) to prioritize development speed, while enforcing reliability through monitoring and automated rollbacks. I collaborate with developers to ensure features are testable and deployable without compromising stability.

- **How do you handle on-call responsibilities, and what’s your process for incident response?**  
  I treat on-call as a proactive duty, monitoring alerts via CloudWatch or PagerDuty. My incident response process is: 1) Acknowledge the alert, 2) Triage (assess severity and impact), 3) Diagnose (check logs, metrics), 4) Mitigate (e.g., scale resources, rollback), 5) Document (post-mortem). I ensure clear communication with the team throughout.

### 2. Cloud (AWS)

- **You’ve worked with AWS services like EC2, EKS, S3, RDS, VPC, and CloudWatch. Can you walk me through how you’ve set up a highly available architecture using these services?**  
  I’ve designed an HA architecture by launching EC2 instances across multiple Availability Zones in a VPC, using an Auto Scaling group for resilience. I paired this with an RDS Multi-AZ setup for database failover and S3 for durable storage. EKS managed Kubernetes pods across AZs, and CloudWatch monitored health, triggering scaling or alerts as needed.

- **How do you secure an AWS VPC? What configurations or best practices do you follow?**  
  I secure a VPC by setting private/public subnets, using NAT Gateways for outbound traffic, and restricting inbound access with security groups (e.g., only port 22 from a bastion host). I enable VPC Flow Logs for auditing, use IAM roles instead of keys, and apply NACLs for an extra layer of stateless filtering.

- **How do you use Terraform to manage AWS infrastructure? Can you explain a specific case where you automated provisioning?**  
  I use Terraform to define infrastructure as code, managing resources like EC2, S3, and VPCs. In one case, I automated provisioning of an EKS cluster with Terraform, defining node groups and networking in a `.tf` file, reducing setup time from hours to minutes and ensuring consistency across environments.

  ```hcl
  resource "aws_eks_cluster" "example" {
    name     = "my-cluster"
    role_arn = aws_iam_role.eks.arn
    vpc_config {
      subnet_ids = aws_subnet.example[*].id
    }
  }
  ```

- **What’s your experience with EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service)? How do you manage and scale Kubernetes clusters on AWS?**  
  I’ve deployed EKS clusters to run containerized workloads, managing them with `kubectl` and Terraform. For scaling, I configure Horizontal Pod Autoscalers (HPA) based on CPU/memory metrics from CloudWatch, and use EKS node groups with Auto Scaling to adjust capacity dynamically, ensuring performance under load.

- **How do you set up custom metrics and alarms in CloudWatch? Can you give an example from your experience?**  
  I publish custom metrics to CloudWatch using the AWS CLI or SDK, then create alarms via the console or Terraform. For example, I tracked container restarts in a Kubernetes cluster by pushing a metric (`ContainerRestarts`) and set an alarm to notify via SNS if restarts exceeded 5 in 10 minutes.

  ```bash
  aws cloudwatch put-metric-data --metric-name ContainerRestarts --namespace MyApp --value 3
  ```

---

### 3. CI/CD Pipelines

- **You’ve used Jenkins and GitHub Actions for CI/CD. Can you explain how you designed a pipeline that reduced deployment time by 25%?**  
  I designed a Jenkins pipeline with parallel stages for building, testing, and deploying, caching dependencies to skip redundant steps. I optimized Docker image builds by layering efficiently and used GitHub Actions for lightweight PR checks, cutting deployment time from 20 to 15 minutes.

- **How do you ensure zero downtime during deployments in a CI/CD pipeline?**  
  I implement blue-green deployments, spinning up a new environment (e.g., green) with updated code, testing it, then switching traffic via an AWS ALB. Kubernetes rolling updates also work—setting `maxUnavailable=0` ensures pods stay live during updates.

- **What’s the difference between Jenkins scripted and declarative pipelines? Which do you prefer and why?**  
  Scripted pipelines use Groovy code for flexibility but are harder to read, while declarative pipelines offer a structured, readable syntax with predefined stages. I prefer declarative for its clarity and maintainability, though I use scripted for complex custom logic.

- **How do you handle pipeline failures or rollbacks in Jenkins or GitHub Actions?**  
  In Jenkins, I use `try-catch` blocks in scripted pipelines or `post` conditions in declarative ones to trigger rollbacks (e.g., redeploying a previous image). In GitHub Actions, I add a rollback job with `if: failure()` to revert changes, ensuring quick recovery.

- **How do you integrate security checks (e.g., SAST, DAST) into your CI/CD workflows?**  
  I integrate SAST tools like SonarQube in the build stage to scan code statically, and DAST tools like OWASP ZAP in a test stage against a staging environment. In Jenkins, I add these as steps; in GitHub Actions, I use actions from the marketplace.

---

### 4. Containerization (Docker and Kubernetes)

- **Can you explain how you spearheaded Docker containerization at NielsenIQ? What challenges did you face?**  
  I led containerization by converting monolithic apps into Docker images, creating Dockerfiles, and setting up a registry. Challenges included dependency conflicts (resolved by multi-stage builds) and resistance to change (mitigated by training and demos showing faster deployments).

- **How do you optimize Docker images for faster builds and deployments?**  
  I use multi-stage builds to keep images lean, layer frequently used commands early, and avoid unnecessary files with `.dockerignore`. I also leverage base images from trusted sources and cache layers strategically.

- **What’s your approach to managing Kubernetes deployments? How do you handle scaling and resource allocation?**  
  I manage deployments with YAML manifests, using `kubectl apply` for updates. For scaling, I set HPA based on CPU/memory, define resource limits/requests (e.g., 500m CPU, 1Gi memory), and monitor with `kubectl top` to adjust as needed.

- **How do you troubleshoot a pod that’s crashing in Kubernetes?**  
  I start with `kubectl describe pod` to check events, then `kubectl logs` for errors. If needed, I exec into the pod (`kubectl exec -it`) to inspect processes, check resource limits, and review cluster logs or metrics for root causes like OOM.

- **Tell me about your personal project (Doctor-Patient Interaction System). How did you use Docker Compose to manage multiple containers?**  
  For my Doctor-Patient Interaction System, I used Docker Compose to orchestrate a web app (PHP), database (MySQL), and frontend (HTML/CSS/JS) containers. I defined services in a `docker-compose.yml` file, linking them with a network and setting dependencies (e.g., app waits for DB).

  ```yaml
  version: '3'
  services:
    app:
      image: php:7.4-apache
      ports:
        - "8080:80"
      depends_on:
        - db
    db:
      image: mysql:5.7
      environment:
        MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD: example
  ```

### 5. Automation and Scripting

- **You’ve used Python and Shell Scripting for automation. Can you walk me through a specific script you wrote to optimize container management?**  
  I wrote a Shell script to automate Docker container cleanup. It identified stopped containers and dangling images using `docker ps -a` and `docker images`, then removed them with `docker rm` and `docker rmi`. This reduced resource usage on nodes by freeing up disk space and memory.

  ```bash
  #!/bin/bash
  docker ps -a -q --filter "status=exited" | xargs -r docker rm
  docker images -q --filter "dangling=true" | xargs -r docker rmi
  ```

- **How do you decide when to use Python vs. Shell Scripting for a task?**  
  I use Shell for quick, system-level tasks like file manipulation or command chaining, as it’s lightweight and fast. Python is my choice for complex logic, data processing, or tasks needing libraries (e.g., boto3 for AWS), due to its readability and robustness.

- **You mention improving performance by 30% with automation. Can you explain the problem, your solution, and how you measured the impact?**  
  The problem was slow manual container restarts during scaling events, taking 10 minutes. I automated it with a Python script that monitored Kubernetes pod health via API and restarted failed pods, cutting time to 7 minutes. I measured impact by tracking average response time pre- and post-automation.

- **How do you approach writing efficient algorithms for system-level automation?**  
  I focus on minimizing I/O and CPU usage—using data structures like hashes for lookups, avoiding nested loops, and caching results. I test with real data, profile with tools like `time` or `cProfile`, and iterate to reduce runtime complexity.

- **Have you used Ansible for automation? How does it compare to Terraform in your experience?**  
  Yes, I’ve used Ansible to automate server configs and app deployments. Ansible excels at configuration management (e.g., installing packages), while Terraform is better for infrastructure provisioning (e.g., creating AWS resources). Ansible is agentless and procedural; Terraform is declarative and state-driven.

### 6. Databases (Snowflake SQL)

- **You built a real-time data aggregation system with Snowflake SQL. What challenges did you encounter, and how did you address them?**  
  Challenges included high query latency and data freshness. I addressed latency by partitioning tables and optimizing joins, and ensured freshness by scheduling micro-batches with Snowflake tasks, keeping aggregation delays under 5 minutes.

- **How do you optimize Snowflake SQL queries for performance? Can you give an example of a complex query you wrote?**  
  I optimize by clustering tables on frequently filtered columns, using materialized views, and avoiding full table scans. Example: a query to calculate daily sales trends.

  ```sql
  SELECT DATE_TRUNC('day', order_date) AS day,
         SUM(order_amount) AS total_sales,
         RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY day ORDER BY total_sales DESC) AS sales_rank
  FROM orders
  WHERE order_date >= '2023-01-01'
  GROUP BY day;
  ```

- **What are window functions, and how did you use them to improve reporting accuracy by 45%?**  
  Window functions perform calculations across rows related to the current row, like `RANK()` or `SUM() OVER()`. I used them to deduplicate and rank data in reports, replacing error-prone subqueries, boosting accuracy from 55% to 100% in some cases.

- **How do you handle large datasets in Snowflake? What’s your approach to cost optimization?**  
  I handle large datasets by partitioning on time or key columns, using clustering keys, and leveraging Snowflake’s auto-scaling. For cost, I set resource monitors, suspend unused warehouses, and prune unnecessary columns with `SELECT` statements.

- **What’s the role of Freemarker Templates in your database work? Can you explain a use case?**  
  Freemarker Templates generate dynamic SQL queries. I used them to create parameterized report queries, like sales by region, where the template injected filters based on user input, reducing query duplication and maintenance effort.

---

### 7. Monitoring and Observability

- **How do you use AWS CloudWatch to ensure system reliability? Can you describe a custom monitoring solution you built?**  
  I use CloudWatch to track metrics like CPU usage and latency, setting alarms for anomalies. I built a solution to monitor EKS pod restarts, pushing a custom metric (`PodRestarts`) via CLI and alerting if it exceeded a threshold.

- **What’s your process for setting up alerting thresholds? How do you avoid alert fatigue?**  
  I set thresholds based on historical baselines (e.g., 95th percentile latency) and SLOs, testing with synthetic loads. To avoid fatigue, I prioritize critical alerts, use escalation policies, and suppress noise with anomaly detection.

- **How do you debug a performance issue in a distributed system?**  
  I start with metrics (e.g., CPU, latency) to narrow scope, then check logs for errors, and use tracing (e.g., X-Ray) to pinpoint bottlenecks across services, iterating until resolved.

- **What other monitoring tools have you used besides CloudWatch, and how do they compare?**  
  I’ve used Prometheus and Grafana. Prometheus excels at time-series data and Kubernetes monitoring with rich querying, while Grafana visualizes it better. CloudWatch is simpler but less flexible and costlier at scale.

- **How do you correlate logs, metrics, and traces to5 to troubleshoot an issue?**  
  I correlate by aligning timestamps across logs (e.g., app logs), metrics (e.g., CPU usage), and traces (e.g., request paths), using tools like CloudWatch Logs Insights or ELK to find patterns, then test hypotheses with targeted experiments.

---

### 8. Linux Administration

- **How do you tune Linux systems for performance? Can you give an example from your experience?**  
  I tune by adjusting kernel parameters (e.g., `vm.swappiness`), optimizing I/O schedulers, and setting CPU governors. Example: I increased throughput on a web server by tweaking `tcp_max_syn_backlog` and `somaxconn` for high traffic.

- **What’s your approach to troubleshooting a high CPU or memory usage issue on a Linux server?**  
  I use `top` or `htop` to identify processes, `vmstat` for memory trends, and `strace` or `perf` for deeper analysis, then kill or limit offending processes and adjust configs.

- **How do you secure a Linux environment for production workloads?**  
  I harden it with minimal packages, SSH key auth only, `ufw` or `iptables` firewalls, regular updates, and AppArmor/SELinux for process isolation.

- **Have you worked with systemd or cron jobs? Can you explain a practical use case?**  
  Yes, I used `systemd` to manage a custom service restarting a monitoring script, and `cron` to schedule nightly backups (`0 0 * * * tar -czf /backup/data.tar.gz /data`).

- **How do you manage disk space and prevent outages due to storage issues?**  
  I monitor with `df` and `du`, set up alerts for 80% usage, automate cleanup of old logs with `find` and `rm`, and expand partitions with `resize2fs` if needed.

### 9. Team Collaboration and Mentorship

- **You mentored junior engineers in DevOps best practices. What topics did you focus on, and how did you measure their progress?**  
  I focused on CI/CD pipelines, containerization basics (Docker/Kubernetes), and AWS fundamentals. I measured progress by tracking their ability to independently deploy apps, reduce pipeline errors (e.g., from 5 to 1 per week), and complete hands-on tasks like writing a basic Dockerfile.

- **How do you handle conflicts or misalignments between development and operations teams?**  
  I facilitate open discussions to align goals, using data (e.g., error rates, deployment times) to mediate. I propose compromises like staged rollouts to balance dev velocity with ops stability, ensuring mutual understanding through shared metrics.

- **How do you document your work to ensure knowledge sharing across teams?**  
  I maintain wikis (e.g., Confluence) with pipeline configs, architecture diagrams, and troubleshooting guides. I use READMEs in repos for code-specific docs and record post-mortems to capture lessons learned, ensuring accessibility and clarity.

- **Can you describe a time when you partnered with Release Management to drive a cloud-native approach?**  
  I collaborated with Release Management to migrate a legacy app to AWS EKS, defining a cloud-native release process with Terraform for infra and Jenkins for automated deployments. This reduced release cycles from days to hours, validated by stakeholder feedback.

---

### 10. Problem-Solving and Scenarios

- **Imagine a production deployment fails due to a misconfigured Kubernetes pod. How do you diagnose and fix it?**  
  I run `kubectl describe pod <name>` to check events, then `kubectl logs <name>` for errors. If it’s a config issue (e.g., wrong image), I edit the YAML with `kubectl edit deployment <name>` or rollback with `kubectl rollout undo deployment <name>`, verifying with `kubectl get pods`.

- **A critical application is experiencing latency spikes. Walk me through your troubleshooting process.**  
  I check CloudWatch for CPU/memory spikes, review app logs for slow queries, and use `kubectl top` if containerized. I trace requests with AWS X-Ray, isolate bottlenecks (e.g., DB), and mitigate by scaling resources or optimizing code, confirming with latency metrics.

- **Your CI/CD pipeline is taking too long to complete. What steps would you take to optimize it?**  
  I analyze stage times in Jenkins/GitHub Actions, parallelize tasks (e.g., tests), cache dependencies (e.g., Maven artifacts), and use smaller Docker base images. I test the optimized pipeline, aiming for a 20-30% time reduction.

- **An AWS EC2 instance keeps crashing due to memory issues. How do you investigate and resolve it?**  
  I use `top` or `free -m` to confirm memory usage, check `dmesg` for OOM killer logs, and review app logs. I resolve by increasing instance size (`aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute`), adding swap, or tuning app memory limits, verifying with uptime checks.

- **How would you design a disaster recovery plan for an application running on AWS?**  
  I’d use multi-region replication (RDS read replicas, S3 cross-region replication), automate backups with EBS snapshots, and script failover with Route 53 DNS. I’d test recovery time objectives (RTO) and data loss (RPO) via drills, aiming for <1 hour downtime.

### 11. Projects and Achievements

- **Tell me more about your real-time data aggregation system. How did you achieve a 20% efficiency increase?**  
  I built it with Snowflake SQL, using partitioned tables and scheduled tasks for near-real-time updates. Efficiency rose 20% by optimizing query joins and caching results, measured by reduced processing time from 10 to 8 minutes per batch.

- **How did you measure the 30% reduction in deployment misalignments with Jenkins pipelines?**  
  I tracked failed deployments (e.g., image mismatches) via Jenkins logs pre- and post-optimization. After syncing app images with Terraform and Jenkins, failures dropped from 10 to 7 per 100 deployments, a 30% improvement.

- **For your Doctor-Patient Interaction System, how did you ensure security and scalability?**  
  I secured it with HTTPS, MySQL user auth, and input validation in PHP. For scalability, I used Docker Compose for multi-container orchestration and tested load with 100 concurrent users, ensuring response times stayed under 500ms.

- **What was the most challenging part of optimizing build workflows with Maven?**  
  Managing dependency conflicts across microservices was tough. I resolved it by centralizing versions in a parent POM, reducing build failures from 15% to 2%, though aligning team adoption took extra effort.

- **Can you explain a situation where your automation saved significant time or resources?**  
  I automated AWS infrastructure provisioning with Terraform, cutting setup from 2 hours to 20 minutes per environment. This saved 10+ hours weekly across 5 deployments, validated by team time logs.

  It deepened my understanding of CI/CD, containers, and cloud basics, letting me implement Jenkins pipelines and Docker deployments confidently, directly improving team workflows.

- **What did you learn from “Jenkins, From Zero to Hero” that you applied practically?**  
  I learned advanced pipeline techniques like parallel stages and shared libraries. I applied this to split a monolithic Jenkinsfile into reusable modules, speeding up pipeline edits by 50%.

  ```groovy
  // Example shared library call
  @Library('my-lib') _
  pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
      stage('Build') { steps { buildApp() } }
    }
  }
  ```

- **How do you stay updated with the latest DevOps trends and tools?**
