1. **What is Python, and what are its key features?**
    - **Answer:**
      Python is a high-level, interpreted, general-purpose programming language known for its readability and simplicity. Created by Guido van Rossum and first released in 1991, it supports multiple programming paradigms like procedural, object-oriented, and functional programming.
      - **Key Features:**
         - Readable Syntax: Code is easy to read and write, resembling English-like statements.
         - Interpreted: Executes code line-by-line, making debugging easier.
         - Dynamically Typed: No need to declare variable types explicitly.
         - Extensive Standard Library: Offers a wide range of modules and packages for tasks like file I/O, networking, and more.
         - Cross-Platform: Runs on Windows, macOS, Linux, etc.
         - Supports Multiple Paradigms: Allows procedural, OOP, and functional programming.
         - Garbage Collection: Automatically manages memory.
         - Community Support: Has a large, active community and ecosystem (e.g., NumPy, Django).

2. **Explain the difference between Python 2 and Python 3.**
    - **Answer:**
      Python 2 and Python 3 are two major versions of Python, with Python 3 being the current, actively maintained version (Python 2 reached end-of-life in January 2020).
      - **Key Differences:**
         - Print Statement: Python 2 uses `print "Hello"` (statement), while Python 3 uses `print("Hello")` (function).
         - Integer Division: In Python 2, `5 / 2` returns `2` (integer); in Python 3, it returns `2.5` (float).
         - Unicode Support: Python 3 has native Unicode support for strings (default), while Python 2 treats strings as ASCII unless explicitly declared as Unicode with `u"string"`.
         - `xrange` vs `range`: Python 2 has `xrange()` for memory-efficient iteration; Python 3 replaces it with an improved `range()`.
         - Syntax Improvements: Python 3 introduces features like f-strings, keyword-only arguments, and better exception handling.
         - Library Support: Python 3 has modern libraries; many Python 2 libraries are no longer maintained.

3. **What are PEP 8 guidelines, and why are they important?**
    - **Answer:**
      PEP 8 is Pythonâ€™s official style guide, written by Guido van Rossum, Barry Warsaw, and Nick Coghlan. It provides conventions for writing clean, readable Python code.
      - **Key Guidelines:**
         - Use 4 spaces for indentation (no tabs).
         - Limit lines to 79 characters.
         - Use snake_case for variables/functions and CamelCase for classes.
         - Add a space around operators (e.g., `x = 1` not `x=1`).
         - Include docstrings for modules, classes, and functions.
      - **Importance:**
         - Enhances code readability and consistency, especially in collaborative projects.
         - Reduces errors caused by poor formatting.
         - Aligns with community standards, making code more maintainable.

4. **How is Python an interpreted language?**
    - **Answer:**
      Python is an interpreted language because it executes code line-by-line without requiring a separate compilation step. When you run a Python script, the interpreter reads the source code, converts it to bytecode (an intermediate representation), and then executes it in the Python Virtual Machine (PVM).
      - **Process:**
         - Source code (e.g., `script.py`) is written.
         - The Python interpreter compiles it to bytecode (`.pyc` files).
         - The PVM executes the bytecode.
      Unlike compiled languages (e.g., C), Python doesnâ€™t produce a standalone executable, making it slower but easier to debug and portable across platforms.

5. **What are the differences between lists, tuples, and sets in Python?**
    - **Answer:**
      - **Lists:** Ordered, mutable collections defined with square brackets `[1, 2, 3]`. You can add, remove, or modify elements (e.g., `append()`, `pop()`). Duplicates are allowed.
      - **Tuples:** Ordered, immutable collections defined with parentheses `(1, 2, 3)`. Once created, elements cannot be changed. Faster than lists due to immutability. Duplicates are allowed.
      - **Sets:** Unordered, mutable collections defined with curly braces `{1, 2, 3}` or `set()`. Automatically removes duplicates. Supports mathematical operations like union and intersection.
      - **Example:**
         ```python
         list_example = [1, 2, 2]  # Mutable, ordered, duplicates OK
         tuple_example = (1, 2, 2) # Immutable, ordered, duplicates OK
         set_example = {1, 2}      # Mutable, unordered, no duplicates
         ```

6. **What is the difference between `==` and `is` in Python?**
    - **Answer:**
      - `==`: Compares the values of two objects for equality. It checks if the contents are the same.
      - `is`: Compares the identity of two objects. It checks if they refer to the same memory location (same object).
      - **Example:**
         ```python
         a = [1, 2, 3]
         b = [1, 2, 3]
         print(a == b)  # True (same values)
         print(a is b)  # False (different objects)
         c = a
         print(a is c)  # True (same object)
         ```

7. **How does Python handle memory management?**
    - **Answer:**
      Python uses automatic memory management through:
      - **Reference Counting:** Each object has a count of references pointing to it. When the count drops to zero, the memory is freed.
      - **Garbage Collector:** Handles cyclic references (e.g., objects referencing each other) that reference counting canâ€™t resolve. The `gc` module manages this.
      - **Memory Allocation:** Pythonâ€™s memory manager (part of CPython) allocates memory in pools and arenas for efficiency.
      - **Example:**
         ```python
         x = [1, 2, 3]  # Reference count = 1
         y = x          # Reference count = 2
         del y          # Reference count = 1
         del x          # Reference count = 0, memory freed
         ```

8. **What are mutable and immutable objects in Python? Give examples.**
    - **Answer:**
      - **Mutable Objects:** Can be changed after creation. Modifications affect the original object. Examples:
         - Lists: `[1, 2, 3]` (can append, remove).
         - Dictionaries: `{"a": 1}` (can add/remove keys).
         - Sets: `{1, 2, 3}` (can add/remove elements).
      - **Immutable Objects:** Cannot be changed after creation. Any modification creates a new object. Examples:
         - Integers: `5` (changing value creates a new integer).
         - Strings: `"hello"` (e.g., `upper()` returns a new string).
         - Tuples: `(1, 2, 3)` (cannot modify elements).
      - **Example:**
         ```python
         x = [1, 2]  # Mutable
         x.append(3) # x is now [1, 2, 3]
         y = "hi"    # Immutable
         y = y + "!" # y is now "hi!", new object created
         ```

9. **What is the purpose of the `pass` statement?**
    - **Answer:**
      The `pass` statement is a null operation in Python. It acts as a placeholder where code is syntactically required but you donâ€™t want any action to occur. Itâ€™s often used in empty loops, functions, or classes during development.
      - **Example:**
         ```python
         def func():
              pass  # To be implemented later

         for i in range(5):
              if i == 3:
                    pass  # Do nothing
              else:
                    print(i)
         ```

10. **How do you swap two variables in Python without using a temporary variable?**
     - **Answer:**
        In Python, you can swap two variables using tuple unpacking in a single line:
        ```python
        a, b = 5, 10
        a, b = b, a  # Now a = 10, b = 5
        ```
        This works because Python evaluates the right-hand side first, creates a tuple `(b, a)`, and then unpacks it into `a, b`. No temporary variable is needed.

11. **What are Pythonâ€™s built-in data types?**
     - **Answer:**
        Pythonâ€™s built-in data types include:
        - **Numeric:** `int` (e.g., `5`), `float` (e.g., `3.14`), `complex` (e.g., `3+4j`).
        - **Sequence:** `str` (e.g., `"hello"`), `list` (e.g., `[1, 2]`), `tuple` (e.g., `(1, 2)`).
        - **Mapping:** `dict` (e.g., `{"key": "value"}`).
        - **Set:** `set` (e.g., `{1, 2}`), `frozenset` (immutable set).
        - **Boolean:** `bool` (`True`, `False`).
        - **NoneType:** `None` (represents absence of a value).

12. **What is the difference between `range()` and `xrange()` (Python 2 vs. Python 3 context)?**
     - **Answer:**
        - **Python 2:** `range()` returns a list of numbers, while `xrange()` returns an iterator (more memory-efficient for large ranges).
        - **Python 3:** `range()` is the only option and behaves like Python 2â€™s `xrange()`, returning a range object (iterator). `xrange()` no longer exists.
        - **Example:**
          ```python
          # Python 3
          r = range(5)  # range(0, 5), an iterator
          print(list(r))  # [0, 1, 2, 3, 4]
          ```

13. **What is a Python module, and how do you import one?**
     - **Answer:**
        A Python module is a file containing Python code (e.g., functions, classes, variables) that can be reused in other programs.
        - **How to Import:**
          - `import module_name`: Imports the entire module.
          - `from module_name import item`: Imports a specific item (e.g., function).
          - `import module_name as alias`: Imports with an alias.
        - **Example:**
          ```python
          import math
          print(math.sqrt(16))  # 4.0

          from math import pi
          print(pi)  # 3.14159
          ```

14. **Explain the `if __name__ == "__main__":` idiom.**
     - **Answer:**
        The `if __name__ == "__main__":` idiom ensures code inside it runs only if the script is executed directly, not when imported as a module. `__name__` is a built-in variable:
        - Set to `"__main__"` when the script is run directly.
        - Set to the moduleâ€™s name when imported.
        - **Example:**
          ```python
          # my_script.py
          def func():
                print("Function called")

          if __name__ == "__main__":
                func()  # Runs only if script is executed directly
          ```

15. **What are `*args` and `**kwargs`, and how are they used?**
     - **Answer:**
        - `*args`: Allows a function to accept a variable number of positional arguments as a tuple.
        - `**kwargs`: Allows a function to accept a variable number of keyword arguments as a dictionary.
        - **Example:**
          ```python
          def example(*args, **kwargs):
                print("Positional args:", args)
                print("Keyword args:", kwargs)

          example(1, 2, 3, name="Alice", age=25)
          # Output:
          # Positional args: (1, 2, 3)
          # Keyword args: {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}
          ```

16. **How do you reverse a string in Python?**  
**Answer:**  
There are several ways to reverse a string in Python:  
- **Using Slicing:** The most Pythonic way is `string[::-1]`.  
    ```python
    s = "hello"
    print(s[::-1])  # "olleh"
    ```
- **Using `reversed()`:** Returns an iterator, which can be joined back into a string.  
    ```python
    s = "hello"
    print("".join(reversed(s)))  # "olleh"
    ```
The slicing method (`[::-1]`) is preferred for its simplicity and readability.

17. **What is string slicing, and how does it work?**  
**Answer:**  
String slicing is a technique to extract a substring using the syntax `string[start:stop:step]`.  
- `start`: Starting index (inclusive).  
- `stop`: Ending index (exclusive).  
- `step`: Increment between indices (default is 1).  
Example:  
    ```python
    s = "Python"
    print(s[0:2])    # "Py" (start=0, stop=2)
    print(s[2:])     # "thon" (from index 2 to end)
    print(s[::-1])   # "nohtyP" (reverse, step=-1)
    ```
If indices are omitted, defaults are used (e.g., `s[:]` returns the full string).

18. **How do you check if a string is a palindrome?**  
**Answer:**  
A palindrome is a string that reads the same forward and backward (e.g., "radar"). To check:  
Reverse the string and compare it with the original.  
Use slicing for efficiency.  
Example:  
    ```python
    def is_palindrome(s):
        s = s.lower()  # Case-insensitive
        return s == s[::-1]

    print(is_palindrome("Radar"))  # True
    print(is_palindrome("hello"))  # False
    ```
This method ignores case; you can also strip spaces or special characters if needed.

19. **Explain the difference between `str.join()` and `str.format()`.**  
**Answer:**  
- `str.join()`: Combines an iterable (e.g., list) of strings into a single string, using the calling string as a separator.  
    ```python
    words = ["hello", "world"]
    print(" ".join(words))  # "hello world"
    ```
- `str.format()`: Formats a string by replacing placeholders `{}` with values.  
    ```python
    name = "Alice"
    print("Hello, {}".format(name))  # "Hello, Alice"
    ```
**Key Difference:** `join()` concatenates strings with a separator; `format()` inserts values into a template string.

20. **How do you convert a string to lowercase or uppercase?**  
**Answer:**  
Use the built-in methods `lower()` and `upper()`:  
- `lower()`: Converts all characters to lowercase.  
- `upper()`: Converts all characters to uppercase.  
Example:  
    ```python
    s = "Hello World"
    print(s.lower())  # "hello world"
    print(s.upper())  # "HELLO WORLD"
    ```
These methods return new strings (since strings are immutable) and leave the original unchanged.

21. **What is the difference between `find()` and `index()` in strings?**  
**Answer:**  
Both locate the first occurrence of a substring, but they handle failure differently:  
- `find()`: Returns the index if found, `-1` if not found.  
- `index()`: Returns the index if found, raises a `ValueError` if not found.  
Example:  
    ```python
    s = "hello"
    print(s.find("l"))    # 2 (first "l" at index 2)
    print(s.find("x"))    # -1 (not found)
    print(s.index("l"))   # 2 (first "l" at index 2)
    # print(s.index("x")) # Raises ValueError
    ```

22. **How would you remove leading and trailing whitespace from a string?**  
**Answer:**  
Use the `strip()` method to remove leading and trailing whitespace:  
- `strip()`: Removes both ends.  
- `lstrip()`: Removes leading (left).  
- `rstrip()`: Removes trailing (right).  
Example:  
    ```python
    s = "  hello world  "
    print(s.strip())   # "hello world"
    print(s.lstrip())  # "hello world  "
    print(s.rstrip())  # "  hello world"
    ```

23. **How do you count the occurrences of a substring in a string?**  
**Answer:**  
Use the `count()` method, which returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of a substring.  
Example:  
    ```python
    s = "hello hello world"
    print(s.count("hello"))  # 2
    print(s.count("l"))      # 3
    ```
Itâ€™s case-sensitive and counts distinct occurrences.

24. **What are f-strings, and how do they compare to older string formatting methods?**  
**Answer:**  
F-strings (introduced in Python 3.6) are a concise way to embed expressions inside string literals using the `f` prefix.  
Example:  
    ```python
    name = "Alice"
    age = 25
    print(f"{name} is {age} years old")  # "Alice is 25 years old"
    ```
**Comparison:**  
- **Old `%` Operator:** `"%s is %d" % (name, age)` â€“ Less readable, error-prone.  
- **`str.format()`:** `"{} is {}".format(name, age)` â€“ Cleaner but verbose.  
- **F-strings:** More readable, faster (evaluated at runtime), and allow direct expressions (e.g., `f"{age + 1}"`).  
F-strings are now the preferred method.

25. **How do you split a string into a list of words?**  
**Answer:**  
Use the `split()` method, which splits a string into a list based on a delimiter (default is whitespace).  
Example:  
    ```python
    s = "hello world"
    print(s.split())      # ["hello", "world"]
    print(s.split("o"))   # ["hell", " w", "rld"] (split on "o")
    ```
Without arguments, it splits on any whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) and removes extra spaces.

26. **How do you remove duplicates from a list?**  
**Answer:**  
There are several ways to remove duplicates from a list:  
- **Using a Set:** Convert the list to a set and back to a list (removes order).  
    ```python
    lst = [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]
    unique_lst = list(set(lst))  # [1, 2, 3]
    ```
- **Using a Loop:** Preserve order with a seen set.  
    ```python
    lst = [1, 2, 2, 3, 1]
    seen = set()
    unique_lst = [x for x in lst if not (x in seen or seen.add(x))]
    # [1, 2, 3]
    ```
The set method is simpler and faster but doesnâ€™t preserve order unless using Python 3.7+ (where sets maintain insertion order).

27. **What is list comprehension, and how does it work? Provide an example.**  
**Answer:**  
List comprehension is a concise way to create lists in Python using a single line of code. It combines a for loop and an optional condition inside square brackets.  
Syntax: `[expression for item in iterable if condition]`  
Example:  
    ```python
    # Square numbers from 0 to 4
    squares = [x**2 for x in range(5)]
    print(squares)  # [0, 1, 4, 9, 16]

    # Even numbers only
    evens = [x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
    print(evens)  # [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
    ```
Itâ€™s more readable and often faster than traditional loops.

28. **How do you sort a list of dictionaries by a specific key?**  
**Answer:**  
Use the `sort()` method or `sorted()` function with the `key` parameter, typically a lambda function that specifies the dictionary key to sort by.  
Example:  
    ```python
    lst = [{"name": "Bob", "age": 25}, {"name": "Alice", "age": 30}, {"name": "Eve", "age": 20}]
    # Sort by 'age'
    sorted_lst = sorted(lst, key=lambda x: x["age"])
    print(sorted_lst)  
    # [{'name': 'Eve', 'age': 20}, {'name': 'Bob', 'age': 25}, {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 30}]
    ```
`sorted()` returns a new list; `lst.sort()` modifies the original list.

29. **What is the difference between `append()` and `extend()` in lists?**  
**Answer:**  
- `append()`: Adds a single element to the end of the list as-is.  
- `extend()`: Adds each element of an iterable (e.g., list) individually to the end of the list.  
Example:  
    ```python
    lst = [1, 2]
    lst.append([3, 4])  # [1, 2, [3, 4]]
    print(lst)

    lst = [1, 2]
    lst.extend([3, 4])  # [1, 2, 3, 4]
    print(lst)
    ```
`append()` treats the argument as one item; `extend()` flattens the iterable.

30. **How do you merge two dictionaries in Python?**  
**Answer:**  
There are multiple ways to merge dictionaries:  
- **Using `|` (Python 3.9+):**  
    ```python
    dict1 = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
    dict2 = {"b": 3, "c": 4}
    merged = dict1 | dict2  # {"a": 1, "b": 3, "c": 4}
    ```
- **Using `update()`:** Modifies the first dictionary.  
    ```python
    dict1 = {"a": 1}
    dict2 = {"b": 2}
    dict1.update(dict2)  # {"a": 1, "b": 2}
    ```
- **Using `**` unpacking (Python 3.5+):**  
    ```python
    merged = {**dict1, **dict2}  # {"a": 1, "b": 3, "c": 4}
    ```
Later values overwrite earlier ones for duplicate keys.

31. **What is the difference between `pop()` and `remove()` in lists?**  
**Answer:**  
- `pop(index)`: Removes and returns the element at the specified index (default is last element).  
- `remove(value)`: Removes the first occurrence of the specified value (doesnâ€™t return it).  
Example:  
    ```python
    lst = [1, 2, 3, 2]
    print(lst.pop(1))  # 2, lst = [1, 3, 2]
    lst.remove(2)      # lst = [1, 3]
    print(lst)
    ```
`pop()` is index-based; `remove()` is value-based.

32. **How do you check if a key exists in a dictionary?**  
**Answer:**  
Use the `in` operator or the `get()` method:  
- `in`: Returns `True` if the key exists.  
    ```python
    d = {"a": 1, "b": 2}
    print("a" in d)  # True
    ```
- `get()`: Returns the value if the key exists, or `None` (or a default) if not.  
    ```python
    print(d.get("c"))       # None
    print(d.get("c", 0))    # 0 (default value)
    ```
`in` is straightforward; `get()` is useful when you need a fallback.

33. **What are dictionary comprehensions? Provide an example.**  
**Answer:**  
Dictionary comprehensions are a concise way to create dictionaries using a single line, similar to list comprehensions.  
Syntax: `{key: value for item in iterable}`  
Example:  
    ```python
    # Square numbers as values
    squares = {x: x**2 for x in range(5)}
    print(squares)  # {0: 0, 1: 1, 2: 4, 3: 9, 4: 16}

    # Filter example
    evens = {x: x**2 for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0}
    print(evens)  # {0: 0, 2: 4, 4: 16, 6: 36, 8: 64}
    ```
Itâ€™s efficient and readable for creating dictionaries dynamically.

34. **How do set operations like union, intersection, and difference work in Python?**  
**Answer:**  
Sets support mathematical operations:  
- **Union (`|` or `union()`)**: Combines all unique elements from both sets.  
- **Intersection (`&` or `intersection()`)**: Returns elements common to both sets.  
- **Difference (`-` or `difference()`)**: Returns elements in the first set but not the second.  
Example:  
    ```python
    set1 = {1, 2, 3}
    set2 = {2, 3, 4}
    print(set1 | set2)  # {1, 2, 3, 4} (union)
    print(set1 & set2)  # {2, 3} (intersection)
    print(set1 - set2)  # {1} (difference)
    ```
These operations are fast due to setsâ€™ hash table implementation.

35. **How would you flatten a nested list in Python?**  
**Answer:**  
To flatten a nested list (e.g., `[[1, 2], [3, 4]]` to `[1, 2, 3, 4]`):  
- **Using List Comprehension with Nested Loop:**  
    ```python
    nested = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
    flat = [x for sublist in nested for x in sublist]
    print(flat)  # [1, 2, 3, 4]
    ```
- **Using `itertools.chain`:**  
    ```python
    from itertools import chain
    nested = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
    flat = list(chain(*nested))
    print(flat)  # [1, 2, 3, 4]
    ```
For deeper nesting, recursion or `itertools.chain.from_iterable()` may be needed.

36. **What is a lambda function, and when would you use it?**  
**Answer:**  
A lambda function is an anonymous, inline function defined using the `lambda` keyword. It can take any number of arguments but has a single expression.  
**Syntax:** `lambda arguments: expression`  
**Example:**  
```python
add = lambda x, y: x + y
print(add(2, 3))  # 5
```
**When to Use:**  
- Short, simple operations (e.g., sorting key: `sorted(lst, key=lambda x: x[1])`).  
- When passing a function as an argument to `map()`, `filter()`, or similar.  
- Avoid complex logic (use regular functions instead).

37. **Explain the difference between `map()`, `filter()`, and `reduce()`.**  
**Answer:**  
- `map()`: Applies a function to every item in an iterable, returning a map object (convertible to a list).  
    ```python
    lst = [1, 2, 3]
    result = map(lambda x: x**2, lst)  # Squares each element
    print(list(result))  # [1, 4, 9]
    ```
- `filter()`: Filters an iterable based on a function that returns True or False, returning a filter object.  
    ```python
    lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    result = filter(lambda x: x % 2 == 0, lst)  # Keeps even numbers
    print(list(result))  # [2, 4]
    ```
- `reduce()`: (From `functools`) Applies a function cumulatively to items in an iterable, reducing it to a single value.  
    ```python
    from functools import reduce
    lst = [1, 2, 3, 4]
    result = reduce(lambda x, y: x + y, lst)  # Sums all elements
    print(result)  # 10
    ```
**Key Difference:** `map()` transforms, `filter()` selects, `reduce()` aggregates.

38. **How do you define default arguments in a function?**  
**Answer:**  
Default arguments are defined in the function signature by assigning values to parameters. If the caller omits those arguments, the default values are used.  
**Example:**  
```python
def greet(name, message="Hello"):
        print(f"{message}, {name}")

greet("Alice")         # "Hello, Alice"
greet("Bob", "Hi")     # "Hi, Bob"
```
**Note:** Default arguments must follow non-default arguments in the signature.

39. **What is recursion, and how do you implement it in Python?**  
**Answer:**  
Recursion is when a function calls itself to solve a problem by breaking it into smaller subproblems. It requires a base case to stop.  
**Example (Factorial):**  
```python
def factorial(n):
        if n == 0:  # Base case
                return 1
        return n * factorial(n - 1)  # Recursive case

print(factorial(5))  # 120 (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)
```
Python has a recursion limit (default 1000) to prevent stack overflow.

40. **How does Python handle variable scope (LEGB rule)?**  
**Answer:**  
Python resolves variable scope using the LEGB rule:  
- **L (Local):** Inside the current function.  
- **E (Enclosing):** In outer functions (for nested functions).  
- **G (Global):** At the module level.  
- **B (Built-in):** Pythonâ€™s built-in namespace (e.g., `len`, `print`).  
**Example:**  
```python
x = "global"
def outer():
        x = "enclosing"
        def inner():
                x = "local"
                print(x)  # "local"
        inner()
outer()
```
Python searches from innermost (L) to outermost (B) scope.

41. **What are decorators, and how do you create one?**  
**Answer:**  
Decorators are functions that modify or enhance other functions or methods. They use the `@decorator_name` syntax and wrap the target function.  
**Example:**  
```python
def my_decorator(func):
        def wrapper():
                print("Before the function")
                func()
                print("After the function")
        return wrapper

@my_decorator
def say_hello():
        print("Hello!")

say_hello()
# Output:
# Before the function
# Hello!
# After the function
```
Theyâ€™re commonly used for logging, timing, or access control.

42. **How do you pass a function as an argument to another function?**  
**Answer:**  
Functions are first-class objects in Python, so you can pass them as arguments by name (without parentheses).  
**Example:**  
```python
def greet():
        print("Hello")

def call_func(func):
        func()

call_func(greet)  # "Hello"
```
This is useful in callbacks, `map()`, or event handling.

43. **What is the difference between a shallow copy and a deep copy?**  
**Answer:**  
- **Shallow Copy:** Copies the top-level structure but references nested objects. Use `copy.copy()`.  
- **Deep Copy:** Copies all levels recursively, creating independent objects. Use `copy.deepcopy()`.  
**Example:**  
```python
import copy
lst = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
shallow = copy.copy(lst)
deep = copy.deepcopy(lst)

shallow[0][0] = 9
print(lst)      # [[9, 2], [3, 4]] (shallow affects original)
print(deep)     # [[1, 2], [3, 4]] (deep is independent)
```
Shallow is faster but risky with nested mutables.

44. **How do you handle exceptions in a function?**  
**Answer:**  
Use `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks to handle exceptions:  
- **try:** Code that might raise an exception.  
- **except:** Catches and handles the exception.  
- **else:** Runs if no exception occurs.  
- **finally:** Always runs (cleanup).  
**Example:**  
```python
def divide(a, b):
        try:
                result = a / b
        except ZeroDivisionError:
                print("Cannot divide by zero")
        else:
                print(f"Result: {result}")
        finally:
                print("Execution complete")

divide(10, 2)  # Result: 5.0, Execution complete
divide(10, 0)  # Cannot divide by zero, Execution complete
```

45. **What is the purpose of the `global` keyword?**  
**Answer:**  
The `global` keyword allows a function to modify a variable in the global scope instead of creating a local one.  
**Example:**  
```python
x = 10
def modify():
        global x
        x = 20

modify()
print(x)  # 20
```
Without `global`, assigning to `x` inside the function would create a local variable instead.

46. **What are the key principles of OOP in Python?**  
**Answer:**  
The key principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python are:  
- **Encapsulation:** Bundling data (attributes) and methods into a class, restricting direct access to some components (e.g., using private attributes).  
- **Inheritance:** Allowing a class to inherit attributes and methods from another class, promoting code reuse.  
- **Polymorphism:** Enabling different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass, with methods behaving differently based on the object.  
- **Abstraction:** Hiding complex implementation details and exposing only essential features (e.g., via abstract classes).  
Python supports these through classes, objects, and features like decorators and inheritance.

47. **What is the difference between a class and an object?**  
**Answer:**  
- **Class:** A blueprint or template that defines attributes (data) and methods (behavior) for objects. It doesnâ€™t occupy memory until instantiated.  
- **Object:** An instance of a class, created from the class blueprint, with its own specific data.  
**Example:**  
```python
class Dog:  # Class
        def bark(self):
                print("Woof!")

dog1 = Dog()  # Object (instance of Dog)
dog1.bark()   # "Woof!"
```
The class defines the structure; the object is a concrete realization.

48. **How do you implement inheritance in Python?**  
**Answer:**  
Inheritance is implemented by defining a subclass that inherits from a parent (base) class by passing the parent class name in parentheses. The subclass inherits attributes and methods.  
**Example:**  
```python
class Animal:  # Parent class
        def speak(self):
                print("I can speak")

class Dog(Animal):  # Subclass
        def bark(self):
                print("Woof!")

dog = Dog()
dog.speak()  # "I can speak" (inherited)
dog.bark()   # "Woof!" (specific to Dog)
```
Python also supports multiple inheritance (e.g., `class Child(Parent1, Parent2)`).

49. **What is method overriding, and how does it work?**  
**Answer:**  
Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method already defined in its parent class. The subclass version takes precedence.  
**Example:**  
```python
class Animal:
        def speak(self):
                print("Generic sound")

class Dog(Animal):
        def speak(self):  # Overrides parent method
                print("Woof!")

dog = Dog()
dog.speak()  # "Woof!" (not "Generic sound")
```
It allows customization of inherited behavior.

50. **Explain the difference between `self` and `cls` in Python.**  
**Answer:**  
- **self:** Refers to the current instance of a class in instance methods. Itâ€™s the first parameter of instance methods.  
- **cls:** Refers to the class itself in class methods. Itâ€™s the first parameter of methods decorated with `@classmethod`.  
**Example:**  
```python
class MyClass:
        class_var = "Iâ€™m a class variable"

        def instance_method(self):
                print("Instance:", self)

        @classmethod
        def class_method(cls):
                print("Class:", cls.class_var)

obj = MyClass()
obj.instance_method()  # Refers to obj
MyClass.class_method() # Refers to MyClass
```
`self` is for instance-specific data; `cls` is for class-level data.

51. **What are static methods and class methods? How do you define them?**  
**Answer:**  
- **Static Methods:** Donâ€™t take `self` or `cls` as parameters; theyâ€™re utility functions tied to a class. Defined with `@staticmethod`.  
- **Class Methods:** Take `cls` as the first parameter and can access/modify class state. Defined with `@classmethod`.  
**Example:**  
```python
class MyClass:
        @staticmethod
        def static_func():
                print("No access to instance or class")

        @classmethod
        def class_func(cls):
                print("Access to class:", cls)

MyClass.static_func()  # "No access to instance or class"
MyClass.class_func()   # "Access to class: <class '__main__.MyClass'>"
```
Static methods are independent; class methods work with the class.

52. **What is polymorphism in Python? Provide an example.**  
**Answer:**  
Polymorphism allows different classes to be treated as instances of a common superclass, with methods behaving differently based on the object.  
**Example:**  
```python
class Cat:
        def sound(self):
                return "Meow"

class Dog:
        def sound(self):
                return "Woof"

def make_sound(animal):
        print(animal.sound())

cat = Cat()
dog = Dog()
make_sound(cat)  # "Meow"
make_sound(dog)  # "Woof"
```
The same function (`make_sound`) works with different objects, showcasing polymorphism.

53. **How do you implement encapsulation in Python?**  
**Answer:**  
Encapsulation restricts direct access to an objectâ€™s data, achieved using naming conventions:  
- **Public:** No underscore (e.g., `self.name`).  
- **Protected:** Single underscore (e.g., `self._name`) â€“ convention, not enforced.  
- **Private:** Double underscore (e.g., `self.__name`) â€“ name mangling.  
**Example:**  
```python
class Person:
        def __init__(self, name):
                self.__name = name  # Private

        def get_name(self):  # Public method
                return self.__name

p = Person("Alice")
print(p.get_name())    # "Alice"
# print(p.__name)      # AttributeError (mangled to _Person__name)
```
Getters/setters provide controlled access.

54. **What is the purpose of the `__init__` method?**  
**Answer:**  
The `__init__` method is a constructor in Python, automatically called when an object is created. It initializes the instanceâ€™s attributes.  
**Example:**  
```python
class Car:
        def __init__(self, brand):
                self.brand = brand  # Initialize attribute

car = Car("Toyota")
print(car.brand)  # "Toyota"
```
It sets up the objectâ€™s initial state.

55. **What are abstract base classes (ABCs), and how do you use them?**  
**Answer:**  
Abstract Base Classes (ABCs) define a blueprint for other classes, enforcing that subclasses implement specific methods. Use the `abc` module.  
**Example:**  
```python
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod

class Shape(ABC):
        @abstractmethod
        def area(self):
                pass

class Circle(Shape):
        def __init__(self, radius):
                self.radius = radius
        
        def area(self):  # Must implement
                return 3.14 * self.radius ** 2

circle = Circle(5)
print(circle.area())  # 78.5
# shape = Shape()     # TypeError: Can't instantiate abstract class
```
ABCs ensure a consistent interface across subclasses.

56. How would you implement a stack in Python?  
**Answer:**  
A stack is a LIFO (Last In, First Out) data structure. You can implement it using a Python list with `append()` for push and `pop()` for pop.  
**Example:**  
```python
class Stack:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = []
    
    def push(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)
    
    def pop(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items.pop()
        return None
    
    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.items) == 0

stack = Stack()
stack.push(1)
stack.push(2)
print(stack.pop())  # 2
```
Lists make it simple; `collections.deque` is an alternative for efficiency.

57. How would you implement a queue in Python?  
**Answer:**  
A queue is a FIFO (First In, First Out) data structure. Use `collections.deque` for efficient appends and pops from both ends.  
**Example:**  
```python
from collections import deque

class Queue:
    def __init__(self):
        self.items = deque()
    
    def enqueue(self, item):
        self.items.append(item)
    
    def dequeue(self):
        if not self.is_empty():
            return self.items.popleft()
        return None
    
    def is_empty(self):
        return len(self.items) == 0

queue = Queue()
queue.enqueue(1)
queue.enqueue(2)
print(queue.dequeue())  # 1
```
`deque` is preferred over a list for O(1) operations at both ends.

58. What is a binary search, and how do you implement it?  
**Answer:**  
Binary search finds an element in a sorted array by repeatedly dividing the search range in half. Time complexity is O(log n).  
**Example (Iterative):**  
```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    left, right = 0, len(arr) - 1
    while left <= right:
        mid = (left + right) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            left = mid + 1
        else:
            right = mid - 1
    return -1

arr = [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
print(binary_search(arr, 5))  # 2
```
Requires a sorted input; returns the index or -1 if not found.

59. How do you reverse a linked list in Python?  
**Answer:**  
To reverse a linked list, adjust pointers iteratively or recursively. Hereâ€™s an iterative approach:  
**Example:**  
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

def reverse_list(head):
    prev = None
    current = head
    while current:
        next_node = current.next
        current.next = prev
        prev = current
        current = next_node
    return prev

# Create list: 1 -> 2 -> 3
head = Node(1)
head.next = Node(2)
head.next.next = Node(3)

# Reverse it
new_head = reverse_list(head)
while new_head:
    print(new_head.data, end=" ")  # 3 2 1
    new_head = new_head.next
```
Time complexity: O(n), space: O(1).

60. What is the time complexity of common Python list operations (e.g., append, pop, insert)?  
**Answer:**  
- `append()`: O(1) â€“ Adds to the end (amortized).  
- `pop()`: O(1) â€“ Removes from the end.  
- `pop(index)`: O(n) â€“ Removes from a specific index (shifts elements).  
- `insert(index, value)`: O(n) â€“ Inserts at an index (shifts elements).  
- `remove(value)`: O(n) â€“ Finds and removes first occurrence (shifts elements).  
- `in` (membership test): O(n) â€“ Linear search.  
Lists are dynamic arrays, so operations involving shifting are O(n).

61. How do you find the maximum element in a list without using `max()`?  
**Answer:**  
Iterate through the list, keeping track of the largest element seen.  
**Example:**  
```python
def find_max(lst):
    if not lst:
        return None
    max_val = lst[0]
    for num in lst:
        if num > max_val:
            max_val = num
    return max_val

lst = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]
print(find_max(lst))  # 5
```
Time complexity: O(n), space: O(1).

62. How would you implement a hash table in Python?  
**Answer:**  
A hash table maps keys to values using a hash function. Pythonâ€™s `dict` is a built-in hash table, but hereâ€™s a simple custom implementation:  
**Example:**  
```python
class HashTable:
    def __init__(self, size=10):
        self.size = size
        self.table = [[] for _ in range(size)]  # List of lists for chaining
    
    def _hash(self, key):
        return hash(key) % self.size
    
    def put(self, key, value):
        index = self._hash(key)
        for pair in self.table[index]:
            if pair[0] == key:  # Update if key exists
                pair[1] = value
                return
        self.table[index].append([key, value])
    
    def get(self, key):
        index = self._hash(key)
        for pair in self.table[index]:
            if pair[0] == key:
                return pair[1]
        return None

ht = HashTable()
ht.put("apple", 5)
ht.put("banana", 8)
print(ht.get("apple"))  # 5
```
Handles collisions with chaining; average time complexity is O(1).

63. What is a heap, and how can you use the `heapq` module?  
**Answer:**  
A heap is a binary tree where each parent node is less than or equal to its children (min-heap) or greater (max-heap). Pythonâ€™s `heapq` provides min-heap functionality.  
**Example:**  
```python
import heapq

# Create a heap from a list
lst = [3, 1, 4, 1, 5]
heapq.heapify(lst)  # Converts to min-heap
print(lst)  # [1, 1, 4, 3, 5]

# Add element
heapq.heappush(lst, 2)
print(lst)  # [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 4]

# Remove smallest
smallest = heapq.heappop(lst)
print(smallest)  # 1
```
Use for priority queues; operations like push/pop are O(log n).

64. How do you detect a cycle in a linked list?  
**Answer:**  
Use Floydâ€™s Cycle-Finding Algorithm (tortoise and hare): two pointers move at different speeds; if they meet, thereâ€™s a cycle.  
**Example:**  
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, data):
        self.data = data
        self.next = None

def has_cycle(head):
    slow = fast = head
    while fast and fast.next:
        slow = slow.next
        fast = fast.next.next
        if slow == fast:
            return True
    return False

# Create list with cycle: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 2
head = Node(1)
head.next = Node(2)
head.next.next = Node(3)
head.next.next.next = head.next

print(has_cycle(head))  # True
```
Time complexity: O(n), space: O(1).

65. Explain the difference between breadth-first search (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS).  
**Answer:**  
- **BFS:** Explores all nodes at the current depth before moving deeper. Uses a queue.  
  Time: O(V + E), Space: O(V) (V = vertices, E = edges).  
  Good for shortest path in unweighted graphs.
- **DFS:** Explores as far as possible along each branch before backtracking. Uses a stack (or recursion).  
  Time: O(V + E), Space: O(V).  
  Good for topological sorting or detecting cycles.

**Example (Conceptual):**  
For a tree 1 -> (2, 3), BFS visits 1, 2, 3; DFS might visit 1, 2, then 3 (or 1, 3, then 2).

66. How do you read a file line by line in Python?  
**Answer:**  
You can read a file line by line using a `for` loop with an open file object, which iterates over lines efficiently.  
**Example:**  
```python
with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
    for line in file:
        print(line.strip())  # strip() removes trailing newlines
```
This is memory-efficient as it doesnâ€™t load the entire file into memory at once.

67. What is the difference between `read()`, `readline()`, and `readlines()`?  
**Answer:**  
- `read()`: Reads the entire file content into a single string.  
  ```python
  with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
      content = file.read()
  ```
- `readline()`: Reads one line at a time (up to the next newline).  
  ```python
  with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
      line = file.readline()  # First line only
  ```
- `readlines()`: Reads all lines into a list of strings (each line is an element).  
  ```python
  with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
      lines = file.readlines()  # ["line1\n", "line2\n"]
  ```
Key Difference: `read()` is all at once, `readline()` is one line, `readlines()` is a list of lines.

68. How do you write to a file in Python?  
**Answer:**  
Use `open()` with mode "w" (write, overwrites file) or "a" (append), and the `write()` method.  
**Example:**  
```python
with open("file.txt", "w") as file:
    file.write("Hello, world!\n")
    file.write("Another line")
```
"w": Creates a new file or overwrites an existing one.  
Use `writelines()` for a list of strings (no automatic newlines).

69. What is the purpose of the `with` statement when working with files?  
**Answer:**  
The `with` statement ensures proper resource management by automatically closing the file after operations, even if an error occurs. Itâ€™s a context manager.  
**Example:**  
```python
with open("file.txt", "r") as file:
    content = file.read()
# File is automatically closed here
```
Without `with`, youâ€™d need `file.close()` manually, risking resource leaks.

70. How do you append data to an existing file?  
**Answer:**  
Open the file in append mode ("a") and use `write()` to add data at the end.  
**Example:**  
```python
with open("file.txt", "a") as file:
    file.write("Appending this line\n")
```
Unlike "w", "a" doesnâ€™t overwrite existing content; it adds to the end.

71. How do you handle file exceptions (e.g., `FileNotFoundError`)?  
**Answer:**  
Use `try` and `except` to catch exceptions like `FileNotFoundError` or `IOError`.  
**Example:**  
```python
try:
    with open("nonexistent.txt", "r") as file:
        content = file.read()
except FileNotFoundError:
    print("File not found!")
except IOError:
    print("An I/O error occurred")
```
This prevents the program from crashing and allows graceful error handling.

72. How do you read and write CSV files in Python?  
**Answer:**  
Use the `csv` module:  
- **Reading:** Use `csv.reader` or `csv.DictReader`.  
- **Writing:** Use `csv.writer` or `csv.DictWriter`.  
**Example:**  
```python
import csv

# Writing
with open("data.csv", "w", newline="") as file:
    writer = csv.writer(file)
    writer.writerow(["Name", "Age"])
    writer.writerow(["Alice", 25])

# Reading
with open("data.csv", "r") as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    for row in reader:
        print(row)  # ['Name', 'Age'], ['Alice', '25']
```
`newline=""` ensures consistent line endings across platforms.

73. How do you work with JSON files in Python?  
**Answer:**  
Use the `json` module:  
- **Reading:** `json.load()` (file) or `json.loads()` (string).  
- **Writing:** `json.dump()` (file) or `json.dumps()` (string).  
**Example:**  
```python
import json

# Writing
data = {"name": "Alice", "age": 25}
with open("data.json", "w") as file:
    json.dump(data, file)

# Reading
with open("data.json", "r") as file:
    loaded_data = json.load(file)
    print(loaded_data)  # {'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25}
```
JSON is great for structured data exchange.

74. What is the difference between binary and text file modes?  
**Answer:**  
- **Text Mode** (e.g., "r", "w"): Reads/writes data as strings, with automatic encoding/decoding (e.g., UTF-8). Default mode.  
  ```python
  with open("file.txt", "w") as file:
      file.write("Hello")  # String
  ```
- **Binary Mode** (e.g., "rb", "wb"): Reads/writes raw bytes, no encoding/decoding. Used for non-text files (e.g., images).  
  ```python
  with open("file.bin", "wb") as file:
      file.write(b"Hello")  # Bytes
  ```
Text mode handles line endings; binary mode is exact.

75. How do you delete a file using Python?  
**Answer:**  
Use `os.remove()` from the `os` module to delete a file.  
**Example:**  
```python
import os

file_path = "file.txt"
if os.path.exists(file_path):
    os.remove(file_path)
    print("File deleted")
else:
    print("File not found")
```
Check existence with `os.path.exists()` to avoid errors; `os.unlink()` is a synonym.

76. **What is the difference between `import module` and `from module import *`?**  
**Answer:**  
- `import module`: Imports the entire module, and you access its contents with dot notation (e.g., `module.function()`).  
    ```python
    import math
    print(math.sqrt(16))  # 4.0
    ```
- `from module import *`: Imports all public names (variables, functions, etc.) from the module into the current namespace, so you can use them directly.  
    ```python
    from math import *
    print(sqrt(16))  # 4.0
    ```
- **Key Difference:** `import module` is safer and avoids namespace pollution; `from module import *` is convenient but risks name conflicts.

77. **How do you install a third-party library using pip?**  
**Answer:**  
Use `pip`, Pythonâ€™s package manager, from the command line:  
- Install a library: `pip install library_name`  
    ```bash
    pip install requests
    ```
- Specific version: `pip install library_name==version`  
    ```bash
    pip install requests==2.28.1
    ```
- Upgrade: `pip install --upgrade library_name`  
    ```bash
    pip install --upgrade requests
    ```
Run in a terminal; ensure `pip` matches your Python version (e.g., `pip3` for Python 3).

78. **What is the purpose of the `sys` module?**  
**Answer:**  
The `sys` module provides access to system-specific parameters and functions, interacting with the Python interpreter.  
Examples:  
- `sys.argv`: List of command-line arguments.  
    ```python
    import sys
    print(sys.argv)  # ['script.py', 'arg1', 'arg2']
    ```
- `sys.exit()`: Exits the program.  
    ```python
    sys.exit(0)  # 0 = success
    ```
- `sys.path`: List of directories Python searches for modules.  
Itâ€™s useful for scripting and runtime control.

79. **How do you generate random numbers using the `random` module?**  
**Answer:**  
The `random` module provides functions for generating pseudo-random numbers.  
Example:  
    ```python
    import random

    print(random.randint(1, 10))    # Random int between 1 and 10 (inclusive)
    print(random.random())          # Random float between 0.0 and 1.0
    print(random.choice([1, 2, 3])) # Random element from a sequence
    random.shuffle([1, 2, 3])       # Shuffles list in place
    ```
Use `random.seed()` for reproducible results.

80. **What is the `datetime` module, and how do you use it?**  
**Answer:**  
The `datetime` module handles dates and times in Python, providing classes like `datetime`, `date`, and `timedelta`.  
Example:  
    ```python
    from datetime import datetime, timedelta

    # Current date and time
    now = datetime.now()
    print(now)  # e.g., 2025-03-24 12:00:00

    # Add 2 days
    future = now + timedelta(days=2)
    print(future)

    # Format date
    print(now.strftime("%Y-%m-%d"))  # "2025-03-24"
    ```
Itâ€™s used for date arithmetic and formatting.

81. **How do you use the `os` module to interact with the operating system?**  
**Answer:**  
The `os` module provides functions to interact with the operating system, like file operations and directory management.  
Example:  
    ```python
    import os

    print(os.getcwd())          # Current working directory
    os.mkdir("new_folder")      # Create a directory
    os.remove("file.txt")       # Delete a file
    print(os.listdir("."))      # List directory contents
    print(os.path.join("dir", "file.txt"))  # "dir/file.txt" (path joining)
    ```
Itâ€™s platform-independent for file and system tasks.

82. **What is `numpy`, and how does it differ from Python lists?**  
**Answer:**  
NumPy is a library for numerical computing, providing a powerful `ndarray` (n-dimensional array) object.  
Differences from Lists:  
- **Performance:** NumPy arrays are faster due to fixed-type, contiguous memory.  
- **Functionality:** Supports vectorized operations (e.g., element-wise addition).  
- **Homogeneous:** All elements must be the same type (unlike lists).  
Example:  
    ```python
    import numpy as np

    arr = np.array([1, 2, 3])
    print(arr + 2)  # [3, 4, 5] (vectorized)
    lst = [1, 2, 3]
    # lst + 2  # TypeError with lists
    ```
NumPy is ideal for scientific computing.

83. **How do you create a virtual environment in Python?**  
**Answer:**  
A virtual environment isolates Python dependencies for a project. Use the `venv` module:  
Steps:  
    ```bash
    # Create virtual environment
    python -m venv myenv

    # Activate (Windows)
    myenv\Scripts\activate

    # Activate (Linux/Mac)
    source myenv/bin/activate

    # Deactivate
    deactivate
    ```
Once activated, `pip install` installs packages locally in `myenv`, avoiding global conflicts.

84. **What is the purpose of the `collections` module?**  
**Answer:**  
The `collections` module provides specialized container data types beyond built-ins like lists and dicts.  
Examples:  
- **Counter:** Counts occurrences of elements.  
    ```python
    from collections import Counter
    print(Counter("hello"))  # Counter({'l': 2, 'h': 1, 'e': 1, 'o': 1})
    ```
- **deque:** Double-ended queue for fast appends/pops.  
- **defaultdict:** Dictionary with default values for missing keys.  
It enhances functionality for specific use cases.

85. **How do you use the `re` module for regular expressions?**  
**Answer:**  
The `re` module handles pattern matching and text manipulation using regular expressions.  
Example:  
    ```python
    import re

    text = "Contact: 123-456-7890"
    # Search for pattern
    match = re.search(r"\d{3}-\d{3}-\d{4}", text)
    print(match.group())  # "123-456-7890"

    # Replace
    new_text = re.sub(r"\d", "X", text)
    print(new_text)  # "Contact: XXX-XXX-XXXX"

    # Find all matches
    numbers = re.findall(r"\d+", text)
    print(numbers)  # ["123", "456", "7890"]
    ```
Use `search()`, `match()`, `findall()`, or `sub()` for pattern operations.

86. **What is exception handling, and why is it important?**  
**Answer:**  
Exception handling is the process of managing errors (exceptions) that occur during program execution, preventing crashes. It uses constructs like `try` and `except` to catch and respond to issues.  
**Why Important:**  
- Prevents program termination due to unexpected errors.  
- Improves robustness and user experience.  
- Allows graceful recovery or logging of issues (e.g., file not found).  
Without it, unhandled exceptions stop execution abruptly.

87. **How do you use `try`, `except`, `else`, and `finally` blocks?**  
**Answer:**  
- `try`: Contains code that might raise an exception.  
- `except`: Catches and handles specific exceptions.  
- `else`: Runs if no exception occurs in `try`.  
- `finally`: Always executes, regardless of exceptions (e.g., cleanup).  
Example:  
    ```python
    try:
            result = 10 / 2
    except ZeroDivisionError:
            print("Division by zero!")
    else:
            print(f"Result: {result}")
    finally:
            print("Done")
    # Output: Result: 5.0, Done
    ```
It structures error handling logically.

88. **How do you raise a custom exception in Python?**  
**Answer:**  
Use the `raise` keyword, optionally creating a custom exception class by inheriting from `Exception`.  
Example:  
    ```python
    class MyError(Exception):
            pass

    def check_positive(num):
            if num < 0:
                    raise MyError("Number must be positive!")
            return num

    try:
            check_positive(-5)
    except MyError as e:
            print(e)  # "Number must be positive!"
    ```
Custom exceptions improve code specificity.

89. **What is the difference between an error and an exception?**  
**Answer:**  
- **Error:** A broad term for anything that goes wrong (e.g., syntax errors, logical errors). Some are unrecoverable (e.g., `SyntaxError`).  
- **Exception:** A specific type of error during runtime that can be caught and handled (e.g., `ZeroDivisionError`, `FileNotFoundError`).  
Example:  
    ```python
    print(1/0)  # ZeroDivisionError (exception, catchable).
    if True print("hi")  # SyntaxError (error, not catchable).
    ```
Exceptions are manageable; many errors arenâ€™t.

90. **How do you catch multiple exceptions in a single `except` block?**  
**Answer:**  
List multiple exceptions in a tuple within a single `except` clause.  
Example:  
    ```python
    try:
            num = int(input("Enter a number: "))
            result = 10 / num
    except (ValueError, ZeroDivisionError) as e:
            print(f"Error: {e}")
    ```
- `ValueError`: If input isnâ€™t an integer.  
- `ZeroDivisionError`: If `num` is 0.  
This reduces repetitive code.

91. **What happens if an exception is not handled?**  
**Answer:**  
If an exception isnâ€™t handled, Python propagates it up the call stack. If it reaches the top without a handler, the program terminates, displaying a traceback with the exception type and message.  
Example:  
    ```python
    def divide(a, b):
            return a / b

    print(divide(10, 0))  # ZeroDivisionError: division by zero
    # Program stops with traceback
    ```
Unhandled exceptions crash the program.

92. **How do you log exceptions using the `logging` module?**  
**Answer:**  
Use the `logging` module to record exceptions instead of printing them, with levels like `DEBUG`, `INFO`, or `ERROR`.  
Example:  
    ```python
    import logging

    logging.basicConfig(filename="app.log", level=logging.ERROR)
    try:
            result = 10 / 0
    except ZeroDivisionError as e:
            logging.error("An error occurred", exc_info=True)
    ```
`exc_info=True` logs the full traceback.  
Output goes to `app.log` for later analysis, improving debugging.

93. **What is the purpose of the `assert` statement?**  
**Answer:**  
The `assert` statement tests a condition; if False, it raises an `AssertionError` with an optional message. Itâ€™s used for debugging or enforcing invariants.  
Example:  
    ```python
    x = -1
    assert x >= 0, "x must be non-negative"
    # Raises AssertionError: x must be non-negative
    ```
Disabled in production with `-O` flag (`python -O script.py`).

94. **How do you handle a `KeyError` in a dictionary?**  
**Answer:**  
Catch a `KeyError` with `try/except`, or use `get()` to avoid it by providing a default value.  
Example:  
    ```python
    d = {"a": 1}
    # Using try/except
    try:
            print(d["b"])
    except KeyError:
            print("Key not found")

    # Using get()
    print(d.get("b", 0))  # 0 (default if "b" not found)
    ```
`get()` is simpler for optional keys; `try` suits complex logic.

95. **What is the difference between `sys.exit()` and raising an exception?**  
**Answer:**  
- `sys.exit()`: Terminates the program immediately with an exit code (e.g., 0 for success, non-zero for failure). From `sys` module.  
    ```python
    import sys
    sys.exit(1)  # Exits with code 1
    ```
- Raising an Exception: Throws an error that can be caught and handled; doesnâ€™t necessarily stop the program unless unhandled.  
    ```python
    raise ValueError("Something went wrong")
    ```
**Key Difference:** `sys.exit()` is a hard stop; exceptions allow recovery if caught.

96. **What are generators, and how do they differ from regular functions?**
Answer:
Generators are functions that produce a sequence of values lazily, one at a time, using `yield`. Unlike regular functions:  
- **Regular Functions**: Return a single value (or list) and exit.  
- **Generators**: Yield values iteratively, maintaining state between calls, and are memory-efficient for large datasets.

Example:
```python
def regular_func():
    return [1, 2, 3]  # All at once

def generator_func():
    for i in [1, 2, 3]:
        yield i  # One at a time

gen = generator_func()
print(next(gen))  # 1
print(next(gen))  # 2
```
Generators save memory by not storing the entire sequence.

97. **How do you create a generator using the yield keyword?**
Answer:
Use `yield` in a function to return a value and pause execution, resuming on the next `next()` call.

Example:
```python
def count_up_to(n):
    i = 0
    while i < n:
        yield i
        i += 1

gen = count_up_to(3)
for num in gen:
    print(num)  # 0, 1, 2
```
Each `yield` produces a value; the functionâ€™s state is preserved between yields.

98. **What is a context manager, and how do you implement one?**
Answer:
A context manager manages resources (e.g., files) by defining setup and teardown logic, typically used with the `with` statement.  
Implementation: Use `__enter__` (setup) and `__exit__` (teardown) methods.

Example:
```python
class MyContext:
    def __enter__(self):
        print("Entering")
        return self
    
    def __exit__(self, exc_type, exc_value, traceback):
        print("Exiting")

with MyContext() as ctx:
    print("Inside")
# Output: Entering, Inside, Exiting
```
The `with` statement ensures `__exit__` runs, even if an error occurs.

99. **What are metaclasses in Python?**
Answer:
Metaclasses are classes of classesâ€”they define how classes are created. The default metaclass is `type`. Use them to customize class creation.

Example:
```python
class MyMeta(type):
    def __new__(cls, name, bases, dct):
        print(f"Creating class {name}")
        return super().__new__(cls, name, bases, dct)

class MyClass(metaclass=MyMeta):
    pass
# Output: Creating class MyClass
```
Metaclasses are advanced and used for frameworks (e.g., ORMs).

100. **How does multithreading work in Python with the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)?**
Answer:
Multithreading in Python uses the `threading` module to run multiple threads, but the GIL (in CPython) prevents true parallelism for CPU-bound tasks.  
- **GIL**: A mutex that allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time.  
- **Impact**: I/O-bound tasks (e.g., network calls) benefit from threading; CPU-bound tasks donâ€™t due to GIL.

Example:
```python
import threading

def task():
    print("Running")

t = threading.Thread(target=task)
t.start()
t.join()
```
Use `multiprocessing` for CPU-bound parallelism.

101. **What is the difference between multiprocessing and multithreading?**
Answer:
- **Multithreading**: Multiple threads within one process share memory. Limited by GIL for CPU tasks in CPython. Good for I/O-bound work.  
- **Multiprocessing**: Multiple processes with separate memory spaces. Bypasses GIL, ideal for CPU-bound tasks.

Example:
```python
from multiprocessing import Process

def task():
    print("Running")

p = Process(target=task)
p.start()
p.join()
```
Key Difference: Threads share memory; processes donâ€™t, avoiding GIL.

102. **How do you use the asyncio library for asynchronous programming?**
Answer:
`asyncio` enables asynchronous I/O using coroutines with `async` and `await`.

Example:
```python
import asyncio

async def say_hello():
    print("Hello")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)  # Simulate I/O
    print("World")

asyncio.run(say_hello())
# Output: Hello, (1s pause), World
```
Use `asyncio.run()` to execute coroutines; itâ€™s great for concurrent I/O tasks.

103. **What are closures, and how do they work in Python?**
Answer:
A closure is a nested function that captures and remembers variables from its enclosing scope, even after the outer function finishes.

Example:
```python
def outer(x):
    def inner(y):
        return x + y  # x is "closed over"
    return inner

add_five = outer(5)
print(add_five(3))  # 8
```
The inner function retains access to `x` via closure.

104. **How do you profile a Python program for performance?**
Answer:
Use the `cProfile` module to measure execution time and identify bottlenecks.

Example:
```python
import cProfile

def slow_func():
    total = 0
    for i in range(1000000):
        total += i
    return total

cProfile.run("slow_func()")
```
Output shows time per function call. Use `time` module for simpler timing or third-party tools like `line_profiler` for line-by-line analysis.

105. **What is the difference between `__str__` and `__repr__`?**
Answer:
- `__str__`: Returns a human-readable string representation (for end users). Called by `str()` and `print()`.  
- `__repr__`: Returns an unambiguous string representation (for developers/debugging). Called by `repr()`.

Example:
```python
class Point:
    def __init__(self, x, y):
        self.x, self.y = x, y
    
    def __str__(self):
        return f"Point({self.x}, {self.y})"
    
    def __repr__(self):
        return f"Point(x={self.x}, y={self.y})"

p = Point(1, 2)
print(str(p))   # Point(1, 2)
print(repr(p))  # Point(x=1, y=2)
```
`__str__` is informal; `__repr__` aims for precision.

106. **Write a Python program to find the factorial of a number.**
Answer:
Factorial of a number `n` (n!) is the product of all positive integers up to `n`.

Code:
```python
def factorial(n):
    if n < 0:
        return "Factorial not defined for negative numbers"
    elif n == 0:
        return 1
    else:
        result = 1
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            result *= i
        return result

# Test
print(factorial(5))  # 120 (5 * 4 * 3 * 2 * 1)
print(factorial(0))  # 1
```
Explanation: Uses iteration for simplicity; recursion (`n * factorial(n-1)`) is also valid but less efficient for large `n`.

107. **Write a function to check if a number is prime.**
Answer:
A prime number is greater than 1 and divisible only by 1 and itself.

Code:
```python
def is_prime(n):
    if n <= 1:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

# Test
print(is_prime(7))   # True
print(is_prime(12))  # False
```
Explanation: Checks divisibility up to the square root for efficiency; O(âˆšn) time complexity.

108. **Implement a function to find the Fibonacci sequence up to n terms.**
Answer:
The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0, 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

Code:
```python
def fibonacci(n):
    if n <= 0:
        return []
    elif n == 1:
        return [0]
    fib = [0, 1]
    for i in range(2, n):
        fib.append(fib[-1] + fib[-2])
    return fib

# Test
print(fibonacci(6))  # [0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5]
```
Explanation: Builds the sequence iteratively; O(n) time complexity.

109. **Write a program to find the second largest number in a list.**
Answer:
Track the largest and second largest numbers in a single pass.

Code:
```python
def second_largest(lst):
    if len(lst) < 2:
        return None
    largest = second = float('-inf')
    for num in lst:
        if num > largest:
            second = largest
            largest = num
        elif num > second and num != largest:
            second = num
    return second if second != float('-inf') else None

# Test
print(second_largest([3, 1, 4, 1, 5]))  # 4
print(second_largest([1]))             # None
```
Explanation: O(n) time; handles duplicates by checking `num != largest`.

110. **How would you merge two sorted lists into a single sorted list?**
Answer:
Use a two-pointer approach to compare and merge elements.

Code:
```python
def merge_sorted_lists(list1, list2):
    merged = []
    i, j = 0, 0
    while i < len(list1) and j < len(list2):
        if list1[i] <= list2[j]:
            merged.append(list1[i])
            i += 1
        else:
            merged.append(list2[j])
            j += 1
    merged.extend(list1[i:])  # Add remaining elements
    merged.extend(list2[j:])
    return merged

# Test
print(merge_sorted_lists([1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]))  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
```
Explanation: O(n + m) time, where n and m are list lengths.

111. **Write a function to remove all vowels from a string.**
Answer:
Filter out vowels (a, e, i, o, u, case-insensitive) from the string.

Code:
```python
def remove_vowels(s):
    vowels = set("aeiouAEIOU")
    return "".join(char for char in s if char not in vowels)

# Test
print(remove_vowels("Hello World"))  # "Hll Wrld"
```
Explanation: Uses a set for O(1) lookups; O(n) time, where n is string length.

112. **Implement a binary search tree in Python.**
Answer:
A Binary Search Tree (BST) has nodes where left child < node < right child.

Code:
```python
class Node:
    def __init__(self, value):
        self.value = value
        self.left = None
        self.right = None

class BST:
    def __init__(self):
        self.root = None
    
    def insert(self, value):
        if not self.root:
            self.root = Node(value)
        else:
            self._insert_rec(self.root, value)
    
    def _insert_rec(self, node, value):
        if value < node.value:
            if node.left is None:
                node.left = Node(value)
            else:
                self._insert_rec(node.left, value)
        else:
            if node.right is None:
                node.right = Node(value)
            else:
                self._insert_rec(node.right, value)

# Test
bst = BST()
bst.insert(5)
bst.insert(3)
bst.insert(7)
```
Explanation: Recursive insertion; average O(log n) time for balanced BST.

113. **Write a program to find all anagrams in a list of strings.**
Answer:
Group strings that are anagrams (same characters, different order) using sorted characters as keys.

Code:
```python
def find_anagrams(strings):
    anagram_dict = {}
    for s in strings:
        key = "".join(sorted(s))
        anagram_dict.setdefault(key, []).append(s)
    return [group for group in anagram_dict.values() if len(group) > 1]

# Test
print(find_anagrams(["eat", "tea", "tan", "ate", "nat", "bat"]))
# [['eat', 'tea', 'ate'], ['tan', 'nat']]
```
Explanation: O(n * k * log k) time, where n is list length, k is max string length.

114. **How do you find the longest common substring between two strings?**
Answer:
Use dynamic programming to track common substrings.

Code:
```python
def longest_common_substring(s1, s2):
    m, n = len(s1), len(s2)
    dp = [[0] * (n + 1) for _ in range(m + 1)]
    max_len = 0
    end_idx = 0
    
    for i in range(1, m + 1):
        for j in range(1, n + 1):
            if s1[i-1] == s2[j-1]:
                dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
                if dp[i][j] > max_len:
                    max_len = dp[i][j]
                    end_idx = i
    return s1[end_idx - max_len:end_idx]

# Test
print(longest_common_substring("ABCD", "ABED"))  # "AB"
```
Explanation: O(m * n) time and space; returns the longest common substring.

115. **Write a function to rotate a list by k positions.**
Answer:
Shift elements right by k positions, wrapping around.

Code:
```python
def rotate_list(lst, k):
    if not lst:
        return lst
    k = k % len(lst)  # Normalize k
    return lst[-k:] + lst[:-k]

# Test
print(rotate_list([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2))  # [4, 5, 1, 2, 3]
```
Explanation: Uses slicing; O(n) time, O(n) space. Modulo handles k > len(lst).

116. **How would you optimize a Python script that processes large datasets?**

**Answer:**
To optimize a Python script for large datasets:
- **Use Generators:** Process data lazily (e.g., `yield`) to reduce memory usage.
- **Leverage Libraries:** Use `pandas` or `numpy` for efficient data handling.
- **Avoid Loops:** Replace with vectorized operations (e.g., `numpy` arrays).
- **Profile First:** Use `cProfile` to identify bottlenecks.
- **Chunking:** Process data in smaller batches (e.g., `pandas.read_csv(chunksize=1000)`).
- **Multiprocessing:** Parallelize tasks for CPU-bound work.

**Example:**
```python
import pandas as pd

def process_large_file(file_path):
    for chunk in pd.read_csv(file_path, chunksize=1000):
        # Process chunk
        print(chunk.sum())
```

117. **How do you debug a Python program effectively?**

**Answer:**
- **Print Statements:** Quick way to inspect variables (e.g., `print(var)`).
- **pdb:** Use Pythonâ€™s debugger (`import pdb; pdb.set_trace()`) to step through code.
- **IDE Tools:** Use PyCharm/VS Code breakpoints and variable watches.
- **Logging:** Replace prints with logging for persistent output.
- **Unit Tests:** Isolate issues with small test cases.

**Example (pdb):**
```python
def buggy_func(x):
    y = x / 0  # Bug
    return y

import pdb; pdb.set_trace()
buggy_func(5)  # Step through with 'n' (next), 'p y' (print y)
```

118. **What steps would you take to handle memory leaks in Python?**

**Answer:**
Python uses garbage collection, but leaks can occur with circular references or resource mismanagement:
- **Profile Memory:** Use `tracemalloc` to track allocations.
- **Check References:** Avoid circular references (use `weakref` if needed).
- **Close Resources:** Ensure files, sockets, etc., are closed (use `with`).
- **Enable GC Debugging:** `import gc; gc.set_debug(gc.DEBUG_LEAK)` to detect uncollected objects.
- **Optimize Data Structures:** Use generators or streams for large data.

**Example (tracemalloc):**
```python
import tracemalloc

tracemalloc.start()
# Code to monitor
snapshot = tracemalloc.take_snapshot()
top_stats = snapshot.statistics("lineno")
print(top_stats[:5])
```

119. **How would you design a simple REST API using Python (e.g., with Flask)?**

**Answer:**
Use Flask to create endpoints for CRUD operations:
- **Setup:** Install Flask (`pip install flask`).
- **Define Routes:** Use `@app.route` for GET, POST, etc.
- **Return JSON:** Use `jsonify` for responses.

**Example:**
```python
from flask import Flask, jsonify, request

app = Flask(__name__)

data = []

@app.route('/items', methods=['GET'])
def get_items():
    return jsonify(data)

@app.route('/items', methods=['POST'])
def add_item():
    item = request.json
    data.append(item)
    return jsonify(item), 201

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(debug=True)
```
Run with `python script.py`; test with curl or Postman.

120. **How do you unit test Python code using unittest or pytest?**

**Answer:**
- **unittest:** Built-in, uses test classes and assertions.
- **pytest:** Third-party, simpler syntax, auto-discovers tests.

**Example (unittest):**
```python
import unittest

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

class TestMath(unittest.TestCase):
    def test_add(self):
        self.assertEqual(add(2, 3), 5)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    unittest.main()
```

**Example (pytest):**
```python
# test_math.py
def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
# Run: pytest test_math.py
```
pytest is preferred for its simplicity and plugins.

121. **How would you process a large CSV file without loading it entirely into memory?**

**Answer:**
Use `csv` module with a for loop or `pandas` with chunking:

**Example (csv):**
```python
import csv

with open('large.csv', 'r') as file:
    reader = csv.reader(file)
    next(reader)  # Skip header
    for row in reader:
        print(row)  # Process row-by-row
```

**Example (pandas):**
```python
import pandas as pd

for chunk in pd.read_csv('large.csv', chunksize=1000):
    print(chunk.sum())  # Process chunk
```
Both methods stream data, keeping memory usage low.

122. **How do you handle concurrency in a Python web application?**

**Answer:**
- **Threading:** Use threading or a web frameworkâ€™s thread pool (e.g., Flask with `gunicorn --threads`). Good for I/O-bound tasks.
- **Asyncio:** Use `asyncio` with `aiohttp` or `FastAPI` for async I/O.
- **Multiprocessing:** Use multiprocessing or `gunicorn --workers` for CPU-bound tasks, bypassing GIL.
- **Task Queues:** Use `celery` with a broker (e.g., Redis) for background tasks.

**Example (gunicorn):**
```bash
gunicorn -w 4 app:app  # 4 worker processes
```

123. **What approach would you take to scrape a website using Python?**

**Answer:**
Use `requests` to fetch HTML and `BeautifulSoup` to parse it:

**Steps:**
- Send HTTP request.
- Parse HTML.
- Extract data.
- Handle delays (e.g., `time.sleep`) to respect `robots.txt`.

**Example:**
```python
import requests
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup

url = "http://example.com"
response = requests.get(url)
soup = BeautifulSoup(response.text, 'html.parser')
titles = soup.find_all('h1')
for title in titles:
    print(title.text)
```
Use `selenium` for dynamic sites with JavaScript.

124. **How would you implement a simple caching mechanism in Python?**

**Answer:**
Use a dictionary or `functools.lru_cache` for memoization:

**Example (dict):**
```python
cache = {}

def expensive_function(x):
    if x not in cache:
        cache[x] = x * x  # Simulate computation
    return cache[x]

print(expensive_function(5))  # Computes: 25
print(expensive_function(5))  # Cached: 25
```

**Example (lru_cache):**
```python
from functools import lru_cache

@lru_cache(maxsize=128)
def fib(n):
    if n < 2:
        return n
    return fib(n-1) + fib(n-2)

print(fib(10))  # Cached results
```
`lru_cache` is built-in and handles eviction.

125. **How do you deploy a Python application to production?**

**Answer:**
- **Package:** Use `pyproject.toml` or `setup.py` for dependencies.
- **Server:** Deploy with `gunicorn` (e.g., `gunicorn app:app`) behind Nginx.
- **Environment:** Use a `virtualenv` or Docker container.
- **CI/CD:** Automate with GitHub Actions or Jenkins.
- **Monitoring:** Add logging and tools like Sentry.

**Example (Docker):**
```Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9
WORKDIR /app
COPY . .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt
CMD ["gunicorn", "--bind", "0.0.0.0:8000", "app:app"]
```
Build and run: `docker build -t myapp . && docker run -p 8000:8000 myapp`.
