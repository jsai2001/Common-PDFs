#### Tips for Salary Negotiation

- **Stay Confident but Flexible:** Highlight your achievements (e.g., 25% cost reduction, 30% performance boost) to justify 16 LPA, but quickly pivot to your willingness to settle at 15 LPA to show alignment with their 10-15 LPA range.  
- **Focus on Value:** Tie your skills (Linux, CI/CD, Python, Docker) to their needs (reliable robots, scalable stacks) to reinforce your worth.  
- **Consider the Package:** If they push back, ask about benefits (e.g., bonuses, stock options, learning budgets) to bridge any gap.
