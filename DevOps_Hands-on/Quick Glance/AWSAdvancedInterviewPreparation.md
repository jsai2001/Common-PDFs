### Final Thoughts
With these additional 60 questions, you now have over 160 questions covering foundational, intermediate, and advanced AWS topics. This should be more than enough to prepare for most AWS interviews, even for senior or specialized roles. Tailor your focus based on the role, practice these concepts in the AWS console or via CLI, and simulate explaining your answers to a friend or colleague.

106. **How does AWS Batch differ from AWS Lambda for batch processing?**
AWS Batch is designed for long-running, compute-intensive batch jobs, such as data processing or simulations, where you can define jobs, queues, and compute environments using EC2 or Fargate. AWS Lambda, on the other hand, is serverless and best for short, event-driven tasks, like processing a file upload in seconds. Batch provides more control over resources and supports larger workloads, while Lambda is simpler but limited to a 15-minute runtime. Choose Batch for heavy lifting and Lambda for quick, lightweight tasks.

107. **What are Spot Instances in EC2, and how do you use them to save costs?**
Spot Instances in EC2 allow you to use spare AWS capacity at a steep discount—up to 90% off on-demand prices. They are interruptible, meaning AWS can reclaim them with a two-minute warning if demand rises. To save costs, use them for fault-tolerant, flexible workloads, such as batch processing or testing, by bidding on a price or using Spot Fleets to manage multiple instances. Pair them with Auto Scaling and a fallback to on-demand instances to handle interruptions smoothly.

108. **How do you optimize Lambda functions for performance and cost?**
To optimize Lambda for performance, keep functions small and focused, use the appropriate memory allocation—more memory speeds up execution—and minimize cold starts with provisioned concurrency. For cost optimization, reduce execution time by optimizing code, using efficient libraries, and avoiding over-provisioning memory since cost is tied to duration and resources. Monitor with CloudWatch to identify inefficiencies and adjust triggers to avoid unnecessary invocations.

109. **What are Lambda Layers, and how do they simplify dependency management?**
Lambda Layers allow you to package and share dependencies, such as libraries or runtime environments, separately from your function code. Upload a layer with, for example, a Python package, and attach it to multiple functions, keeping deployment packages small and within Lambda’s size limit. This simplifies management by enabling you to update dependencies once in the layer, rather than in every function, saving time and reducing errors.

110. **How does AWS Step Functions coordinate multiple Lambda functions?**
AWS Step Functions is a workflow service that coordinates multiple Lambda functions or other AWS services by defining a state machine. Write a JSON workflow to sequence tasks, such as calling one Lambda to process data and another to save it, with conditions or parallel execution if needed. It handles retries, timeouts, and error catching automatically, so you don’t have to code that logic into each function, making complex processes cleaner and more reliable.

111. **Difference between cold starts and warm starts in Lambda?**
A cold start occurs when Lambda initializes a new instance to run your function, which adds latency, especially for languages like Java or with larger packages. A warm start is when an existing instance reuses that setup, so it’s faster, just executing the code. Cold starts affect the first requests or during scaling, while warm starts keep things quick for subsequent calls. Minimize cold starts with lighter runtimes or provisioned concurrency.

112. **How would you handle a Lambda function timeout issue?**
If a Lambda function times out, capped at 15 minutes, first check CloudWatch logs to identify where it’s slow, such as a long API call or heavy computation. Optimize the code to run faster, possibly by breaking it into smaller functions or offloading work to Step Functions for longer workflows. Increase the timeout setting if needed, or use a service like AWS Batch or EC2 for tasks that cannot fit within Lambda’s limit.

113. **What is EC2 Instance Metadata Service, and how do you use it?**
The EC2 Instance Metadata Service allows an EC2 instance to access information about itself, such as its IP, IAM role, or instance ID, without extra configuration. Query it by hitting the URL `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/` from inside the instance using a script or command like `curl`. It’s useful for bootstrapping, such as pulling an instance’s role credentials to access S3 securely without hardcoding keys.

114. **How do you implement a hybrid cloud setup with AWS Outposts?**
AWS Outposts brings AWS services, such as EC2, EBS, or RDS, on-premises for a hybrid cloud setup. Start by ordering an Outpost rack from AWS and installing it in your data center with power and networking. Configure it via the AWS console, linking it to your VPC and choosing services to run locally. It syncs with AWS for management, allowing you to use it for low-latency applications or compliance needs while leveraging the cloud for scaling or backups.

115. **How do you transfer petabytes of data to AWS efficiently?**
    To transfer petabytes of data to AWS efficiently, use the AWS Snow family—like Snowball or Snowmobile. Snowball is a physical device that can handle up to 80 terabytes per unit; ship multiple devices to an AWS data center after loading your data. For even larger datasets, Snowmobile—a truck-sized solution—can move exabytes. Once AWS receives it, they upload the data to S3. For ongoing sync, pair it with DataSync or S3 replication to keep everything up to date.

116. **What is S3 Transfer Acceleration, and when should you use it?**
    S3 Transfer Acceleration is a feature that speeds up data uploads to S3 by routing traffic through AWS’s global network of edge locations. It uses optimized protocols to reduce latency. Use it when transferring large files—like videos or backups—over long distances, especially if users are far from the S3 region. It’s ideal for speeding up uploads when network conditions are slow, but test it first to confirm the performance gain justifies the extra cost.

117. **How does S3 Lifecycle Policies work, and how do you configure them?**
    S3 Lifecycle Policies automate moving or deleting objects based on rules you set. For example, transition objects from Standard to Glacier after 30 days, then delete them after a year. To configure them, go to the S3 console, select a bucket, and under the “Management” tab, create a lifecycle rule. Define a prefix or tag to target specific objects, set transition actions—like moving to a cheaper storage class—and expiration actions, then save it. It runs automatically after that.

118. **What is Amazon S3 Select, and how does it improve query performance?**
    Amazon S3 Select lets you query data—like CSV or JSON—directly in S3 using SQL-like expressions without moving it to another service. It improves query performance by pulling only the data you need, not the whole object. For example, if you have a 10GB file but only want one column, S3 Select fetches just that, cutting down retrieval time and costs. It’s great for analytics or log processing where you don’t need the full dataset.

119. **How do you recover a deleted object in S3 with versioning enabled?**
    To recover a deleted object in S3 with versioning enabled, go to the S3 console, enable “Show versions” for the bucket, and find the deleted object—it’ll have a delete marker on the latest version. Simply delete that delete marker, which restores the previous version as the current one. Alternatively, copy an older version to overwrite the delete marker using the AWS CLI or SDK. Versioning keeps all copies, so nothing’s truly gone unless you permanently delete all versions.

120. **What is AWS Data Pipeline, and how does it differ from AWS Glue?**
    AWS Data Pipeline is a service for scheduling and automating data movement and transformation across AWS services—like S3 to Redshift. Use it to define workflows, like nightly ETL jobs. AWS Glue, though, is more advanced—it’s serverless, auto-generates ETL code, and includes a data catalog for metadata. Data Pipeline is better for simple, predefined schedules; Glue shines with big data and auto-scaling, especially when you need to crawl and catalog data first.

121. **How do you use Amazon FSx for Windows-based file storage?**
    Amazon FSx provides fully managed Windows file storage, compatible with SMB protocol. To use it, create an FSx file system in the AWS console, choosing Windows-based storage, and link it to your VPC. Configure Active Directory integration for authentication, then mount it on Windows EC2 instances or on-premises servers using SMB. It’s great for Windows apps—like SQL Server—or shared folders, with features like backups and encryption built in.

122. **Difference between EBS snapshots and AMIs?**
    EBS snapshots are point-in-time backups of a single EBS volume, stored in S3, and use them to restore data or clone volumes. AMIs, or Amazon Machine Images, are broader—they include an EBS snapshot plus the OS and software configuration, so you can launch an entire EC2 instance from them. Snapshots are for storage recovery; AMIs are for spinning up identical instances, like for scaling or disaster recovery.

123. **How do you ensure data durability in S3?**
    S3 ensures data durability—99.999999999% or 11 nines—by automatically replicating objects across multiple Availability Zones in a region. To enhance this, enable versioning to keep old copies, use S3 Cross-Region Replication (CRR) for backups in another region, and turn on MFA Delete for extra protection against accidental deletion. Also, pick the right storage class—like Standard or One Zone-IA—based on your durability needs, but S3’s design handles most of it for you.

124. **What is AWS Storage Gateway, and how does it support hybrid storage?**
    AWS Storage Gateway is a hybrid cloud service that connects on-premises systems to AWS storage. It comes in flavors like File Gateway—for S3-backed file shares—Tape Gateway—for virtual tape backups to S3—and Volume Gateway—for block storage in the cloud. Deploy it as a virtual appliance on-site, and it syncs data to S3 or Glacier while letting local apps access it via standard protocols like NFS or iSCSI. It’s perfect for extending on-premises storage to AWS without a full migration.

125. **How do you configure VPC peering between two VPCs?**
To configure VPC peering between two VPCs, go to the AWS VPC console and create a peering connection request from one VPC, specifying the other VPC’s ID and region. Then, accept the request from the second VPC. Next, update the route tables in both VPCs to include routes pointing to the peered VPC’s CIDR block via the peering connection ID. Finally, ensure security groups and network ACLs allow the traffic. This method connects VPCs without overlapping IP ranges.

126. **What is AWS Transit Gateway, and how does it simplify network architecture?**
AWS Transit Gateway is a service that acts as a central hub to connect multiple VPCs, on-premises networks, and VPNs. It simplifies network architecture by replacing multiple VPC peering connections with a single gateway, reducing complexity. Attach VPCs and VPNs to the Transit Gateway, then use its route table to control traffic flow, such as routing between development and production VPCs. It scales easily and reduces manual routing setup, making management cleaner.

127. **How do you set up a VPN connection between an on-premises network and AWS?**
To set up a VPN connection, start in the VPC console by creating a Customer Gateway with your on-premises router’s public IP. Then, create a Virtual Private Gateway and attach it to your VPC. Next, set up a Site-to-Site VPN connection, linking the two gateways, and download the configuration file AWS provides. Apply that config to your on-premises router using IPsec settings. Finally, update route tables in the VPC to send traffic over the VPN, ensuring secure connectivity.

128. **What is AWS CloudFront, and how does it improve content delivery?**
AWS CloudFront is a content delivery network (CDN) that speeds up the delivery of static and dynamic content, such as web pages, videos, or APIs. It caches content at edge locations worldwide, closer to users, reducing latency. For example, if a user in Asia requests a file from an S3 bucket in the US, CloudFront serves it from a nearby edge point instead of crossing the ocean. It improves performance, reduces load on origin servers, and enhances user experience with faster load times.

129. **How do you configure a custom domain with CloudFront?**
To configure a custom domain with CloudFront, first create a CloudFront distribution and set your origin, such as an S3 bucket or ALB. Then, in the distribution settings, add your custom domain, such as www.example.com, as an alternate domain name. Next, upload an SSL certificate to AWS Certificate Manager for HTTPS, and attach it to the distribution. Finally, update Route 53 to create an alias record pointing your domain to the CloudFront distribution’s domain name, linking it all together.

130. **Difference between Route 53 latency-based routing and geolocation routing?**
Route 53 latency-based routing directs traffic to the AWS region with the lowest network latency for the user, such as sending a US user to us-east-1 if it’s fastest. It focuses on performance. Geolocation routing, however, sends traffic based on the user’s geographic location, such as routing European users to an EU server, regardless of latency. Latency-based routing is best for speed optimization, while geolocation routing is for compliance or localized content, such as language-specific sites.

131. **How do you mitigate a DDoS attack using AWS services?**
To mitigate a DDoS attack, use AWS Shield for basic protection, which is always on and blocks common attacks. For advanced threats, enable AWS Shield Advanced for deeper analysis and cost protection. Pair it with AWS WAF to filter malicious traffic, such as blocking bad IPs or rate-limiting requests, at the CloudFront or ALB level. CloudFront itself helps by distributing traffic across edge locations, and monitor with CloudWatch to spot and react quickly. This layered defense approach enhances security.

132. **What is AWS PrivateLink, and how does it enhance security?**
AWS PrivateLink is a service that allows access to AWS services or third-party apps privately over the AWS network, without crossing the public internet. It creates an interface VPC endpoint tied to a specific service, such as S3 or a partner API. It enhances security by keeping traffic within AWS, avoiding exposure to external threats. For example, use it to connect a private VPC to DynamoDB securely, ensuring data stays off the public grid while still being accessible.

133. **How do you configure a highly available ELB setup across multiple AZs?**
To configure a highly available ELB, create an Elastic Load Balancer, such as an Application Load Balancer, in the AWS console and enable it across at least two Availability Zones in your VPC. Define subnets in each AZ and register your targets, such as EC2 instances, in a target group. The ELB automatically distributes traffic across healthy instances in all AZs. If one AZ fails, it reroutes to the others, ensuring uptime. Enable cross-zone load balancing for even distribution.

134. **What is VPC Flow Logs, and how do you use them for troubleshooting?**
VPC Flow Logs capture network traffic data, such as source, destination, and ports, for a VPC, subnet, or network interface. They are stored in CloudWatch Logs or S3. For troubleshooting, enable Flow Logs in the VPC console, then analyze them to spot issues, such as why an EC2 instance can’t connect to an RDS database. If you see rejected packets, check security groups or ACLs. It acts as a traffic logbook that helps pinpoint connectivity or security problems quickly.

135. **What is AWS Glue, and how does it support ETL processes?**
AWS Glue is a fully managed ETL service—Extract, Transform, Load—that helps prepare and load data for analytics. It automatically discovers data in sources like S3 or RDS using a crawler, builds a catalog in the Glue Data Catalog, and lets you write or generate ETL scripts in Python or Scala. It supports ETL by simplifying data cleaning, transformation, and movement—like converting raw logs into a format for Redshift—saving time with its serverless setup.

136. **How does Amazon Kinesis process real-time data streams?**
Amazon Kinesis processes real-time data streams by ingesting, storing, and analyzing data as it arrives—like logs or IoT sensor data. You can use Kinesis Data Streams to capture the data, where it’s split into shards for parallel processing. Then, you can use Kinesis Data Analytics to run SQL queries on the stream, or Kinesis Firehose to load it into S3 or Redshift. It’s fast and scalable, handling millions of records per second in real time.

137. **Difference between Kinesis Data Streams and Kinesis Firehose?**
Kinesis Data Streams is for custom, real-time data processing—you control the consumers, like a Lambda function, and set shard capacity for flexibility. Kinesis Firehose, though, is simpler and fully managed—it captures data and delivers it directly to destinations like S3 or Redshift with built-in transformations, no coding needed. Streams are for low-latency, hands-on use cases; Firehose is for easy, batch-style loading.

138. **How do you use Amazon Athena to query data in S3?**
To use Amazon Athena, start by storing data in S3—like CSV or JSON files. Then, go to the Athena console, create a table in the Glue Data Catalog to define the schema, either manually or with a crawler. After that, write SQL queries in Athena to analyze the data directly in S3—no need to load it elsewhere. It’s serverless, so you just pay per query, making it great for ad-hoc analysis.

139. **What is Amazon EMR, and how does it process big data workloads?**
Amazon EMR—Elastic MapReduce—is a managed service for processing big data using frameworks like Hadoop, Spark, or Hive. It spins up EC2 clusters to crunch large datasets—like terabytes of logs or user data—and you can scale it up or down as needed. EMR handles the setup and management, so you focus on running jobs, like analyzing trends or training models, with output stored in S3 or elsewhere.

140. **How do you optimize a Redshift cluster for performance?**
To optimize a Redshift cluster, start by choosing the right node type—like dense compute for speed—and sizing it to your workload. Use distribution keys to spread data evenly across nodes and sort keys to speed up queries. Also, run VACUUM and ANALYZE commands to maintain table health, avoid over-querying with WLM (Workload Management), and compress data to save space and boost performance.

141. **What is AWS Lake Formation, and how does it simplify data lakes?**
AWS Lake Formation is a service that simplifies building and managing data lakes on S3. It automates tasks like data ingestion, cataloging, and security—say, pulling data from RDS or S3 into a lake. It uses the Glue Data Catalog to organize data and lets you set fine-grained access controls with IAM or Lake Formation permissions. It cuts down setup time and makes governance easier for analytics.

142. **How do you integrate Amazon QuickSight with other AWS services?**
To integrate Amazon QuickSight, connect it to data sources like S3, Redshift, or RDS via the QuickSight console. For S3, use a manifest file or Glue crawler to define the data; for databases, set up VPC access if needed. You can also pull real-time data from Kinesis or trigger refreshes with Lambda. Once connected, QuickSight builds dashboards—like sales reports—directly from these services.

143. **What is the role of AWS DataSync in data migration?**
AWS DataSync automates and accelerates data migration between on-premises storage and AWS—or between AWS services like S3 and EFS. It uses a lightweight agent on-premises to securely transfer files over the internet or Direct Connect, handling retries and encryption. Use it to move terabytes of data—like backups or archives—to S3 fast, with scheduling and monitoring built in.

144. **How do you secure sensitive data in a data lake on AWS?**
To secure sensitive data in a data lake, encrypt it at rest with KMS and in transit with TLS. Use Lake Formation to set row- and column-level access controls, tied to IAM policies, so only authorized users see specific data. Store the lake in S3 with private buckets, enable versioning, and log access with CloudTrail. Regular audits with AWS Config ensure compliance, too.

145. **What is Amazon SageMaker, and how does it support ML workflows?**
Amazon SageMaker is a fully managed service for building, training, and deploying machine learning models. It supports the entire ML workflow: preprocessing data, choosing algorithms, training models with scalable compute, and deploying them for predictions. Features include Jupyter notebooks, automatic model tuning, and integration with S3 for data storage.

146. **How do you deploy a trained model using SageMaker?**
To deploy a trained model in SageMaker, train it using a SageMaker training job and save the model artifacts to S3. Create a model object in SageMaker linked to those artifacts and specify the inference code. Set up an endpoint configuration with the instance type and count for scaling, and deploy it as a real-time endpoint. Send data to the endpoint for predictions via API calls.

147. **What is AWS Lex, and how does it differ from Amazon Alexa?**
AWS Lex is a service for building conversational interfaces using voice and text. It uses natural language understanding and speech recognition. Amazon Alexa is a consumer-facing virtual assistant designed for end-users. Lex is for developers to create custom bots, while Alexa is a ready-to-use product.

148. **How does Amazon Comprehend process natural language?**
Amazon Comprehend is a natural language processing service that analyzes text to extract insights. It identifies entities, sentiment, key phrases, and topics using pre-trained models. Send text via the API, and it returns structured data without requiring training.

149. **What is AWS Rekognition, and what are its use cases?**
AWS Rekognition is a computer vision service that analyzes images and videos using deep learning. It can detect objects, faces, text, or emotions. Use cases include facial recognition, content moderation, and media analysis. Upload files to S3 and call its APIs to get results.

150. **How do you use AWS DeepLens for deep learning projects?**
AWS DeepLens is a deep learning-enabled video camera for hands-on projects. Train a model in SageMaker, then deploy it to the DeepLens device. The camera runs the model locally, processing video in real-time. It integrates with Lambda for custom actions and is ideal for learning or prototyping vision-based solutions.

151. **Difference between SageMaker Ground Truth and manual labeling?**
SageMaker Ground Truth is a data labeling service that combines human workers and machine learning to label datasets faster and more accurately. It uses active learning to automate parts of the process. Manual labeling involves doing it all by hand without automation. Ground Truth scales better, ensures consistency, and saves time for large datasets.

152. **How do you optimize costs in a SageMaker training job?**
To optimize costs in a SageMaker training job, use smaller instance types for initial testing and scale to more powerful ones for final runs. Enable managed spot training to use cheaper Spot Instances. Preprocess data to reduce training time and use hyperparameter tuning wisely. Monitor with CloudWatch to stop non-converging jobs early.

153. **What is Amazon Forecast, and how does it work?**
Amazon Forecast is a time-series forecasting service for predicting things like sales or inventory demand. It uses machine learning to analyze historical data and generate accurate forecasts. Import data, select an algorithm, train the model, and get predictions via an API. It handles seasonality and trends automatically.

154. **How do you integrate ML models with Lambda for real-time inference?**
To integrate an ML model with Lambda for real-time inference, train and save the model, and store it in S3. Create a Lambda function, load the model from S3, and write logic to process input data and return predictions. Trigger it with an API Gateway for real-time calls, keeping the function lightweight and using layers for dependencies.

155. **How would you architect a real-time analytics system on AWS?**
To architect a real-time analytics system on AWS, I’d use Amazon Kinesis to ingest streaming data—like user clicks or IoT sensor readings—in real time. Kinesis Data Streams would capture the data, and I’d process it with Kinesis Data Analytics using SQL queries to extract insights instantly. For storage, I’d send the processed data to Amazon S3, and for visualization, I’d integrate it with Amazon QuickSight for live dashboards. I’d add Lambda for any custom processing and ensure scalability by adjusting shard counts in Kinesis based on load.

156. **A client needs to process 100TB of logs daily—how would you design the solution?**
For processing 100TB of logs daily, I’d design a solution with Amazon S3 as the landing zone for raw logs, uploaded via Snowball for the initial bulk or direct transfer for ongoing data. I’d use AWS Glue to crawl and catalog the logs, then process them with an EMR cluster running Spark for distributed computing power. Processed data would go to S3 or Redshift for analysis, depending on query needs. I’d automate this with Step Functions and monitor costs with CloudWatch, optimizing EMR instance types for efficiency.

157. **How do you handle a security breach in an AWS environment?**
If there’s a security breach in AWS, I’d first isolate the affected resources—like locking down EC2 instances or S3 buckets—using security groups and IAM policies. I’d check CloudTrail logs to trace the breach’s source and scope, then revoke compromised credentials via IAM. Next, I’d patch vulnerabilities, like updating software or tightening permissions, and notify stakeholders. Finally, I’d enable AWS GuardDuty for ongoing threat detection and document the incident for compliance or review.

158. **Design a cost-optimized solution for a startup with unpredictable traffic.**
For a startup with unpredictable traffic, I’d use a serverless architecture to keep costs low. I’d deploy the app with AWS Lambda for compute, paired with API Gateway for requests—it only charges per invocation. For storage, I’d use S3 with Intelligent-Tiering to auto-shift data to cheaper tiers. DynamoDB with on-demand capacity would handle the database, scaling automatically without overprovisioning. I’d add CloudWatch to monitor usage and set budget alerts to catch spikes, keeping it lean and flexible.

159. **How would you migrate a legacy application with no downtime?**
To migrate a legacy app with no downtime, I’d use a phased approach. First, I’d replicate the on-premises database to AWS using DMS, keeping it in sync with the source. I’d deploy the app on EC2 or ECS behind an Application Load Balancer, testing it in parallel. Then, I’d use Route 53 to gradually shift traffic—starting with a small percentage via weighted routing—to the AWS setup. Once validated, I’d fully cut over, decommissioning the old system. This ensures zero downtime with a rollback option if needed.

160. **What steps would you take if an RDS instance runs out of storage?**
If an RDS instance runs out of storage, I’d first check CloudWatch to confirm the issue. I’d increase the allocated storage via the RDS console—RDS supports this without downtime for most engines. If it’s a burstable instance, I’d enable auto-scaling for storage if not already on. Then, I’d analyze the data growth—maybe offload old data to S3 or optimize queries to reduce bloat. Finally, I’d set up alarms in CloudWatch to alert me before it happens again.

161. **How do you recover an EC2 instance after accidental termination?**
If an EC2 instance is accidentally terminated, recovery depends on preparation. If I had an EBS snapshot or AMI, I’d launch a new instance from that—restoring the EBS volume from the snapshot and attaching it. If termination protection wasn’t enabled and no backups exist, recovery’s tough, but I’d check CloudTrail to confirm the action and see if automated scripts caused it. Going forward, I’d enable termination protection and schedule regular snapshots to avoid this.

162. **A Lambda function is hitting its concurrency limit—what do you do?**
If a Lambda function hits its concurrency limit, I’d first check CloudWatch metrics to confirm throttling. I’d request a limit increase from AWS support if needed—default is 1,000 per region. Meanwhile, I’d optimize the function—maybe reduce execution time or batch requests—to lower concurrency demand. I could also use provisioned concurrency to pre-warm capacity for predictable spikes or offload some logic to SQS for queuing, spreading the load over time.

163. **How would you set up a global content delivery system with low latency?**
For a global content delivery system with low latency, I’d use Amazon CloudFront as the CDN. I’d store static content—like images or videos—in S3, configure it as the origin, and enable CloudFront to cache it at edge locations worldwide. I’d use Route 53 with latency-based routing to direct users to the nearest endpoint. For dynamic content, I’d pair it with AWS Global Accelerator to optimize network paths to my app on ALB or EC2, ensuring fast, consistent performance everywhere.

164. **How do you ensure compliance with GDPR in an AWS environment?**
To ensure GDPR compliance in AWS, I’d encrypt all personal data at rest with KMS and in transit with SSL/TLS. I’d use IAM to restrict access to only authorized users and enable CloudTrail for audit logs to track data handling. For data residency, I’d choose EU regions and use S3 bucket policies to prevent cross-border transfers. I’d implement data deletion with lifecycle policies and tag resources for tracking. Finally, I’d leverage AWS Artifact for compliance reports to prove adherence if audited.
