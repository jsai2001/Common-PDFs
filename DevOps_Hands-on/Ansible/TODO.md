# Interview Preparation

This is an incredibly comprehensive list of Ansible topics! You've covered a vast range of concepts, from the basics to quite advanced areas. Let's break down which topics are essential for interviews, which are extra, and which are advanced.

**Essential for Interviews (Must Know)**

These topics are fundamental and are very likely to come up in most Ansible interviews:

1.  **What is Ansible?** (Core concepts, agentless, YAML, SSH)
2.  **Ansible Playbooks** (Structure, purpose, basic syntax)
3.  **Ansible Roles** (Organization, reusability, basic structure)
4.  **Ansible Inventory** (Static vs. dynamic, host grouping)
5.  **Ansible Modules** (Common modules like `command`, `shell`, `copy`, `service`, `package`, `file`, `template`)
6.  **Ansible Variables** (Types, scope, usage)
7.  **Ansible Facts** (Purpose, usage, basic facts)
8.  **Ansible Handlers** (Purpose, usage, `notify`)
9.  **Ansible Loops** (`loop`, basic iteration)
10. **Ansible Conditionals** (`when`, basic operators)
11. **Ansible Templates** (Jinja2, basic usage)
12. **Ansible Vault** (Basic encryption, usage)
13. **Ansible Ad-Hoc Commands** (Basic usage, quick tasks)
14. **Ansible Tags** (Purpose, usage, running specific tasks)
15. **Ansible Debugging** (Basic techniques, `-v`, `debug` module)
16. **Ansible Blocks** (Basic usage, grouping tasks)
17. **Ansible Best Practices** (Organization, security, readability)
18. **Ansible Idempotence** (Understanding the concept)
19. **Ansible Privilege Escalation** (`become`, `become_user`)
20. **Ansible Check Mode (Dry Run)** (`--check`)
21. **Ansible Command Module vs. Shell Module** (Differences, when to use which)

**Good to Know (Likely Asked)**

These topics are important and show a deeper understanding of Ansible:

1.  **Ansible Galaxy** (Purpose, usage, finding roles)
2.  **Ansible Collections** (Purpose, benefits, basic usage)
3.  **Ansible Filters** (Basic usage, data manipulation)
4.  **Ansible Lookup Plugins** (Basic understanding, usage)
5.  **Ansible Dynamic Inventory** (Basic concept, benefits)
6.  **Ansible Error Handling** (`ignore_errors`, `failed_when`)
7.  **Ansible Rolling Updates** (`serial`)
8.  **Ansible Playbook Includes and Imports** (Differences, usage)
9.  **Ansible Playbook Variables Precedence** (Understanding the order)
10. **Ansible Forks** (Basic understanding)

**Advanced/Less Likely in Basic Interviews (But Impressive)**

These topics are more advanced and might be asked in senior-level interviews or specialized roles:

1.  **Ansible Tower / AWX** (Basic understanding, features)
2.  **Ansible Execution Strategies** (`strategy`)
3.  **Ansible Delegates** (`delegate_to`)
4.  **Ansible Testing with Molecule** (Testing roles)
5.  **Ansible Connection Plugins** (Advanced connections)
6.  **Ansible Inventory Plugins** (Advanced inventory management)
7.  **Ansible Task Delegation with delegate_facts**
8.  **Ansible Async Tasks** (`async`, `poll`)
9.  **Ansible Environment Variables** (`environment`)
10. **Ansible Gathering Facts Optimization** (`gather_subset`)
11. **Ansible Fact Caching** (Performance optimization)
12. **Ansible Playbook Retry Files** (`.retry`)
13. **Ansible Playbook Dependencies with Roles** (`meta/main.yml`)
14. **Ansible Vault Integration with Playbooks** (`vars_files`, inline)
15. **Ansible Playbook Handlers with listen** (`listen`)
16. **Ansible Playbook Pre- and Post-Tasks** (`pre_tasks`, `post_tasks`)
17. **Ansible Playbook Loops with with_ Keywords** (Older syntax)
18. **Ansible Playbook Callbacks**

**Extra/Less Likely to be Asked Specifically (But Good Knowledge)**

These topics are more specialized or less frequently asked, but having knowledge of them shows a broader understanding:

* Most of the internal working of ansible itself.

**Topics You Didn't Mention That Are Worth Knowing**

While your list is very thorough, here are a couple of additional points that could be useful:

* **Ansible Configuration (ansible.cfg):** Basic understanding of configuration files and settings.
* **Ansible Network Automation:** If you're interviewing for a networking role, knowledge of Ansible's network modules and capabilities is crucial.

**Key Takeaways for Interview Preparation**

* Focus on the "Essential" topics first.
* Be able to explain concepts clearly and provide examples.
* Practice writing basic playbooks and ad-hoc commands.
* Understand the core principles of Ansible (idempotence, simplicity).
* Be able to explain troubleshooting techniques.

By focusing on these areas, you'll be well-prepared for most Ansible interviews.
