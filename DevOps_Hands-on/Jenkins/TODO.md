  - [ ] Automate the deployment of Docker containers

## Step 8: Managing Jenkins
- [ ] **Learn**: How to manage Jenkins nodes and agents
  - [ ] Add and configure a new Jenkins agent
- [ ] **Practice**: Distribute builds across multiple agents
  - [ ] Configure jobs to run on specific agents

## Step 9: Jenkins Security
- [ ] **Configure**: Jenkins security settings
  - [ ] Set up user authentication and authorization
  - [ ] Manage user roles and permissions
- [ ] **Practice**: Secure Jenkins with SSL
  - [ ] Configure Jenkins to use HTTPS

## Step 10: Project 4 - Jenkins with Kubernetes
- [ ] **Explore**: Jenkins integration with Kubernetes

  - [ ] Use Kubernetes plugins to manage deployments

## Step 11: Advanced Jenkins Features
- [ ] **Learn**: How to use Jenkins Blue Ocean for a modern UI
  - [ ] Install and configure Blue Ocean
- [ ] **Explore**: Jenkins Pipeline as Code using Groovy
  - [ ] Write complex pipelines using the `Jenkinsfile`
- [ ] **Practice**: Use Jenkins Shared Libraries with Groovy
  - [ ] Create and use shared libraries in your pipelines

## Step 12: Project 5 - CI/CD Pipeline for Microservices
- [ ] **Project**: Set up a CI/CD pipeline for a microservices architecture
  - [ ] Write pipelines to build and deploy multiple microservices using Groovy
  - [ ] Automate the integration and deployment processes

## Step 13: Interview Preparation
- [ ] **Review**: Common Jenkins interview questions
  - [ ] What is Jenkins and how does it work?
  - [ ] Explain the architecture of Jenkins.
  - [ ] What are Jenkins Pipelines and how are they structured?
  - [ ] How do you manage plugins in Jenkins?
  - [ ] What are Jenkins agents and how do you configure them?
  - [ ] Explain the use of `Jenkinsfile`.
